      "description": "...says Shivarajkumar, who recently started shooting for Arjun Janya’s 45. Shivarajkumar is eagerly awaiting the release of his much-anticipated film Ghost, directed by Srini. Simultaneously, he has started shooting for Narthan’s Bhairathi Ranagal, produced under his own banner, Geetha Pictures.\n\nAdding to his packed schedule, Shivarajkumar has now joined the sets of Arjun Janya’s directorial debut, 45 and also has Raj B Shetty participating in the shooting. The Century star is excited about his look for the film, but is tightlipped regarding the details of the same.\n\n“Raj, who was in awe of my look, came and hugged me at least 5 times. This praise from a young filmmaker like him, I consider it as a compliment,” says Shivanna. Apart from Shivarajkumar and Raj B Shetty, 45 produced by Ramesh Reddy, features Upendra in the lead cast.\n\nMeanwhile, Shivarajkumar is eagerly awaiting the release of the Big Daddy teaser from Ghost on his birthday on July 12. “Working with fresh directors allows me to showcase different aspects of my talent, making each day on set a unique experience,” says Shivarajkumar, who is also excited about his other project, Captain Miller, alongside Dhanush.

      "description": "The first-time director, nephew of Nagathihalli Chandrashekar, is getting ready to hit the screens. Ramdeep, who has worked with his uncle Nagathihalli Chandrashekar on numerous ventures, is now making his directorial debut with the film, Diamond Cross. The aspiring director attributes his uncle as his main source of inspiration and reveals that his entire career in the film industry has been spent working alongside Nagathihalli Chandrashekar, affectionately referred to as “maestru.”\n\nWhile managing a 9 to 5 job, I simultaneously launched my film career with my uncle in 2002, and I assisted him on all projects except for India v/s England. There was a brief period when I returned to my IT job in the UK for a few years.\n\nHowever, I am delighted to be back and pursuing my true passion for filmmaking,” says Ramdeep, who has recently completed shooting his debut film, Diamond Cross. The director shared the first glimpse of the film and places emphasis on its title, Diamond Cross, which represents the point where ten railway lines intersect.\n\n“The film revolves around a team of social heroes led by the exceptionally talented cyber hacker, Appu, as they engage in a battle against a cybercrime monster known as MD,” reveals Ramdeep. He describes Diamond Cross as a thrilling and action-packed entertainer with an engrossing screenplay.\n\nProduced by Manish Mehta in association with Nagathihalli Creations, the film features Roger Narayan, alongside Roopika, Rajath Annappa, and Manu KM. Ramdeep mentions that apart from a couple of actors, the majority of the cast comprises fresh faces.\n\n“I discovered these talented individuals, who had self-taught themselves action and choreography through a television interview. However, they lacked acting skills, so they received training at my uncle’s Tent House before joining the sets,” he explains.\n\nRamchandra Babu has written the story, screenplay, and dialogues of the film, which has Santhosh Radhakrishnan handling the cinematography and editing. The background music is composed by Anish Cherian. ",

      "image": "",
      "description": "In this conversation, the actor chats about his latest release Sathi Gani Rendu Ekaralu, his journey in acting, his filmmaking aspirations and more  Jagadeesh Prathap’s interesting trajectory within the world of cinema, from relative obscurity to fame with his breakout role as Kesava, Allu Arjun’s man Friday and the narrator of 2021’s Pushpa: The Rise is only rivalled by his parallel trajectory towards the film industry itself. “I used to work as a sales executive in an ice cream company, in Warangal. I was responsible for sourcing and supplying snacks to multiplex cinemas in that region. I used to work in catering before that.\n\nThat said, I did always have artistic ambitions,” he says. Jagadeesh mentions that his father, an artist and athlete himself, is his primary role model. “My dad is a postman by profession. He met a lot of people, he used to hear and share innumerable stories along the way. I learnt storytelling from him. My mom, on the other hand, worked in the fields.” Speaking more about his childhood, Jagadeesh says, chuckling, “I was really good at sports as well, especially badminton. I could have probably gone to play at the national level, or at least settled down as a PT coach, but I really wanted fame and that hallowed celebrity life I guess, so here I am.” \n\nNot unlike many actors, including the likes of Nani and SJ Suryah closer to home, it was the craft of direction that caught Jagadeesh’s fancy first. “I am an accidental actor, I initially planned to be a filmmaker first. When I decided I wanted to be a filmmaker, I taught myself acting, enacting dialogues in my room. I was writing stories from my inter itself. I was convinced I could write and narrate stories with ease, direction offered me a creative autonomy that no other craft did.\n\nSo, I started my career by making a short film with my bava, who is a cinematographer. So I took the short film with me and came to Hyderabad, which is where I met Rohit and Sasi.” Rohit Penumatsa and Sasi are filmmakers who run Avanti Cinema, a website and youtube channel for Indie Telugu cinema. “I used to regularly attend their screenings everywhere…be it at Ramanaidu, Saradhi or Prasad Labs. They were impressed by my earnestness, when they saw me take trips from Warangal to Hyderabad and back to just attend their screenings. Soon enough, I got a small role in their web series Story Discussion and I went on to play one of the leads with Nirodyuga Natulu.” \n\nThe path to Sathi Gani Rendu Ekaralu, Jagadeesh’s first film as a male lead, came through gradual turns and steps. “From working with Avanti Cinema, I went on to do supporting roles in films like Mallesham, Palasa 1978 and George Reddy. The work was good, but the money wasn’t. Then I worked in a web series called Gods Of Dharmapuri that changed my life.” Gods of Dharmapuri had Jagadeesh play a character named Chalapathi, from the time he is in his 20s to the time he is in his 50s. The series also made Jagadeesh, a Telangana native, speak in the Kadapa dialect.\n\n“I got my role in Pushpa from Gods of Dharmapuri. My experience speaking in the Kadapa dialect also made me pick up the adjacent Chittoor dialect in Pushpa.” Gods of Dharmapuri was edited by Abhinav Danda, who went on to direct Sathi Gani Rendu Ekaralu. “I was initially hesitant to accept this role, or any role for that matter, because giving my dates to Pushpa 2 was the first priority. I was asked to work in the film again, once it was turned down by a bunch of actors and I went ahead with the film, since the film was also produced by Mythri Movie Makers, who are also backing the Pushpa duology.” \n\nJagadeesh credits Sukumar for mentoring him to be a better performer in the commercial space. “Sukumar sir used to always take me aside and give me tips on handling relationships and strategising my career better. Acting alongside Allu Arjun, who is such a magnanimous presence himself, was a learning experience unto itself. The sets of Pushpa were my film school.” Jagadeesh assures that the stakes of Pushpa 2 will be bigger, and his own role will morph and magnify as the character graph of Pushpa Raj increases. He also has Suresh Pasha, his fellow Avanti Cinema alum Anvesh Michael’s directorial, where he plays the role of an antagonist. \n\nJagadeesh, who also does want to get back to direction in the future signs off by saying, “I am inspired by Vijay Sethupathi’s career. He plays all kinds of roles. Versatility is what I am aspiring for, throughout my career.”  ",

      "image": "",
      "description": "The producer also mentions that he had plans to expand in Hollywood, which were derailed by the pandemic. TG Vishwa Prasad is an exception in the world of traditional Telugu film industry producers. The man behind People Media Factory, which originally started as an IT company before branching out into films, his banner has steadily emerged over the last couple of years as one of the most prolific production houses in Hyderabad.\n\nVishwa Prasad made news recently for buying the theatrical distribution rights of Adipurush in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for around Rs 150 crore. The producer claims that he has not even watched the film so far. “I do not have a habit of watching films I produce. For the longest time, I did not even bother looking at the rushes, which I do right now. I am also looking forward to experiencing Adipurush with the rest of the audience when it hits the theatres.” quips Vishwa Prasad, revealing that the trailer displayed enough potential for him to invest in the film. \n\nThe producer also cites the incentive of having goodwill and positive work relationships with both Prabhas and the Mumbai-based banner and music label T-Series as the reason behind his investment. “T-Series will be working next with Prabhas on Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s police drama Spirit as well. We want to continue associating with T-Series on behalf of the Telugu markets in the long run.” Vishwa Prasad’s People Media Factory is also producing Raja Deluxe, Prabhas’ upcoming comedy film, helmed by Maruthi.\n\nWhen enquired about the film’s lack of steady pre-release promotional announcements and updates, Vishwa Prasad says, “Every film cannot have the same strategy now. We will reveal more details about the Maruthi-Prabhas project at the right time.” \n\nVishwa Prasad reveals with zero hesitation that he intends to make films in the “factory model”, telling that out of the 100 films he has planned to make — he is happy to have reached the 25 films mark with the Pawan Kalyan-Sai Dharam Tej starrer Bro, which is all set to release on July 28. Known for his collaborations with fellow producers like Abhishek Aggarwal, when asked about whether successes or failures are specifically impacted by the nature of the collaboration, Vishwa Prasad says, “We have majorly collaborated with three banners over the years — Blue Planet, Suresh Productions and Abhishek Aggarwal. Through all the collaborations, 98% of the investment came from our end. Luck plays a role I suppose, but collaborating with someone does not specifically tip a film’s scales radically towards positive or negative outcomes.”\n\nFurther reflecting on the unpredictable nature of the film industry,  Vishwa Prasad continues, “We are lucky to have a decent success rate. But it never comes easily to anyone. The path to success in cinema comes after a long journey. What helps along the way, is to set goals and expectations accordingly. Especially expectations. Setting them strategically and conservatively is key to keep disappointment at bay.”\n\nThe producer also mentions that he had plans to expand in Hollywood, which were derailed by the pandemic. “We wanted to do something out of Burbank, California — where you have your major Hollywood studios. The plans were set in motion at 2018 itself but we had to pause a bit due to covid. Now that things are back to normal, we are planning to resume things. I want to make films for Telugu, pan-India and audiences in the West as well.” signs off Vishwa Prasad.  ",

      "image": "",
      "description": "&#39;Shaitan&#39;, Mahi V Raghav&#39;s upcoming crime drama show is set to stream on Hotstar from June 15. Former corporate employee turned filmmaker Mahi V Raghav has made interesting, genre-centric films like the coming-of-age Paathshala, the horror-comedy Anando Brahma or Yatra, based on the life of the late YS Rajashekar Reddy.\n\nIn the second phase of his career as a showrunner, Mahi has created the Hotstar web series \"Save The Tigers\", which is followed by Shaitan, his upcoming crime drama show. Shaitan is set to stream on the same platform from June 15. Mahi chats to CE about Shaitan, his enthusiasm towards embracing the OTT platform, his upcoming film and more\n\nExcerpts \nYou have mentioned in an instagram post, when you were sharing the first look of Shaitan that crime is not something that crime is not a genre that you are comfortable with. Yet you chose to go down this route with your upcoming show. What made you try out this genre despite your initial discomfort?\nCuriosity is what primarily drives me to pick the subjects or stories that I pick. And this curiosity comes from a place of novelty. It takes months and sometimes years for a project to travel from start to finish, so through this time I am not sustained by my skill but rather, my curiosity. So, to answer your question, even though crime is not something I am familiar with, even though it is against my DNA — the potential it gives me to explore and learn is what made me take the plunge.\n\nWhere did the genesis of Shaitan come from?\nI was watching a series on Netflix called Mindhunter, where a group of experts are trying to crack a case by studying the lives and crimes of serial killers. One pattern you did get to see through the show was how all these criminals had a violent, abusive childhood filled with emotional neglect. It sort of dawned on me that most if not all criminals, are victims of the society at large. People are not born to be criminals, they take the path of crime, against better reason, for survival. This is the foundation for this human drama I wanted to make, from a perspective of both empathy and neutrality. There is a difference between crime done with motive and in cold blood versus crime done for survival. My story focuses on the latter.  \n\nIt is interesting you mention empathy, while also saying you are not justifying or condoning your characters’ actions. There seems to be a thin line between both. How do you tackle that challenge as a creator?\nWhen I write something, I am empathetic, non judgemental and I don’t rub off my views on the characters I am writing. I am here to create, not preach, period. \n\nApart from a show like Mindhunter, what else inspired you to create the characters and the world of Shaitan?\nJust turn around the pages of the newspaper. Switch on your television. There is so much crime out there, and it is such a ubiquitous part of the society that we live in. Fact is truly stranger than fiction, and this is something I especially want people criticising against the graphic display of violence in my show to understand. What I have tried to capture in Shaitan is miniscule, \ncompared to the crimes that take place on a daily basis in real life. \n\nUnlike many conventional filmmakers, you have entered OTT with a lot of enthusiasm, citing creative autonomy and executive control as reasons for your transition. How has that journey been like for you?\nI have produced all my films except Anando Brahma. It was not by choice, but it just happened. I learnt filmmaking by losing money and producing them. Little did I know that this experience would come in handy a decade later when OTT presented itself as an opportunity to filmmakers. OTT, creatively and commercially, is a once in a lifetime opportunity to filmmakers. Shaitan could have never been told on film, in a conventional 2 and half hour format. Your stories can transcend spatial and linguistic boundaries. It is a format we must embrace with more enthusiasm and scale. We are a country rich with myths and diverse cultures, brimming with narrative potential. It is also less risky and more organised, so there is also a huge commercial incentive to work in this format. I am happy to make this transition and adapt with the changing times. \n\nYou have recently announced your plans to make a sequel for Yatra, which will focus on the life of YS Jagan. It is different when you make a biopic on someone who is still alive and active, whose political career is still developing, as opposed to making a film on someone who has passed away. How are you approaching this delicate dichotomy as you are gearing towards helming Yatra 2? \nI would beg to differ on any sort of pre-existing notion on how biopics must be made on people who have died. Movies made on the lives of Dhoni and Mary Kom have been accepted very well by the audiences. A story is a story, whether someone is alive or have passed on. The subject of your biopic should be aspirational or inspirational. It is easier though, to make a biopic on a sportsperson, rather than a politician. There is less bias and hatred. I understand where people are coming from, but there is a difference between disagreement and disrespect. I hope I have a story that is dramatic and universal enough even for people. I am still writing it, we will take the plunge once we have a story worth telling the world. ",

      "description": "Ananya Sharma talks about her upcoming show &#39;Artham ayinda Arun Kumar&#39;, her approach to the craft of acting and more A little over a year has elapsed since the second season of 30 Weds 21, the show that made Ananya a household name released. As she awaits the release of her upcoming Aha original web series, Artham Ayinda Arun Kumar (AAAK), the official remake of the Arre original YouTube series Official Chukyagiri, she tells that there is not much difference between shows shot for YouTube and OTT platform. “It is my approach to acting that has really changed things for me along the way. I picked up a lot of things from the directors I have worked with. Earlier, I used to follow their instructions solely — now I feel confident enough to make some decisions regarding my own as well. I am still a director’s actor, I will always be one, but I feel more confident to incorporate my own inputs into my performances,”says Ananya.\n\nAnanya will be reprising the role played by Mithila Palkar in the original. Reflecting on the changes made to her character Pallavi, she says, “I play the role of a girl next door. It is a very subtle, quiet character. Jonathan (Edwards), our director has worked a lot on nativising the character to suit local sensibilities. She is a girl who moved to Hyderabad a couple of years ago, but has made the city her own now.” Continuing to talk more about the character, specifically, the inputs she brought to the table, Ananya says, “I am from Warangal, but my entire schooling took place in Hyderabad. The Telangana dialect comes naturally to me. I, however, did not want Pallavi to have any accent, so I opted to speak neutrally throughout the series.\n\nThis is, at the end of the day, a show about Arun, not Pallavi. Accents usually stand out, so it felt best not to have one with Pallavi, a very simple, regular person.” Another major change from the Hindi original in terms of her character is the lack of spectacles, which were a part of Mithila’s look in the original. Replying to the same, Ananya says, “It was the director’s decision. We did not want my character to look so brainy. The character had to seem more at home with the marketing company she works at.”\n\nThe character she plays in AAAK is worlds apart from the extroverted Meghana alias Maggi she played in 30 Weds 21. When asked about who her real-life persona feels closer to, “I think the way I think is more like Pallavi, subtle and reluctant to seek attention. But that is definitely not who I am on the outside (laughs).” All of 22, and just out of college, is she afraid of getting typecast in the same kind of urban, bubbly roles? “On some level, it is happening. I do look young, it is not unreasonable on their end as well. I hope I get to have more opportunities as time goes on. I would love to do more versatile roles. Action is one genre I really want to be a part of,” signs off Ananya. ",

      "description": "The actor opens up about his new film &#39;Samajavaragamana&#39;, negotiating expectations, what lies ahead of him and more The forthright, droll humour that is characteristic of most Sree Vishnu comedy performances comes through in his off-screen persona as well. “I am not making any pan-India films or big-budget entertainers. I do the small, good films that come to me and I am fortunate to find an audience for them,” he nonchalantly quips midway through the interview. Starting his career in 2009 with a supporting role in his friend Nara Rohith’s film Banam, the actor has steadily gone on to feature in a string of niche, author-backed roles through the last decade, films that have put his unassuming everyman disposition on the map.\n\nExcerpts \nAfter a string of action roles, you seem to be returning to comedy with Samajavaragamana…\nOh yes! I chose to work in this film because of that very reason, I wanted to make people laugh, period. This is a clean, commercial entertainer that has something for the family audience and the youth demographic in equal measure. There are no gimmicks or big surprises here, we intend to bring relief to our viewers. \n\nSo are you trying to say that there isn’t any novelty in the film?\n\nThe characters and the dynamics are the same, vis-a-vis most comedies set around a family. Relatable moments notwithstanding, the kind of situations this family will be thrown into will set the film apart from the rest. There is one plot point in the film that has not been explored in any Telugu film so far. I am fairly confident that the audience will receive this very well.\n \nCould you explain the context behind the title Samajavaragamana a bit? \n\nAs you might be aware — Samajavaragamana has been the title of many a popular song across generations — from K Viswanath’s Sankarabharanam (1980) to Balayya Babu’s Top Hero (1994) to the more recent hit number from Allu Arjun’s Ala Vaikuntapuramuloo (2020). Titles of my films, be it a Raja Raja Chora, Arjuna Phalguna or a Brochevaruevarura had that Acha Telugudhanam with that Sanskrit touch. We wanted to continue that tradition with this film as well. The familiarity of the word Samajavaragamana with Telugu audiences also played a role in us choosing this title. The intention was to have something traditional without sounding too pedantic. The title had to strike a chord with a wide segment of the audience at the same time.\n\nUnlike comedies, your work in other genres has not been received very well. How do you feel about the ups and downs you have in the path of experimentation?\n\nIt is fair for the audience to expect to be entertained. I have noticed that in some of the films I have done earlier, maybe because we were trying to tell too many things or we were in a rather serious zone — those films lost their entertainment factor in the process. It was a relief with Samajavaragamana, to not worry too much about its subject. This was a film I made with a lot of confidence. I intend to continue making films that have a lot of fun in them.\n \nYou have worked with newcomers throughout your career. Directors like Vivek Athreya and Venu Udugula have made their careers after working with you. Do you feel any disappointment with having not worked with a lot of “star” directors over the years?\n\nThere are too many stars today and not enough directors. People making films for stars are not able to secure dates of heroes, if that is the state of things in the top rung of the business, you can imagine how it is for the rest of us. There is little I can do when people have scripts with a certain kind of star or level of stardom in their minds. On the flip side, it is very interesting to work with newcomers.\n \nDo you regret not having attained the kind of stardom that some of your peers enjoy?\n\nNo, not really. Nobody can control who becomes a star and who does not. Being an actor, getting good at the craft is comparatively more doable and I believe I have achieved that in my time here. I am also happy that despite doing smaller and more niche films, my producers have never suffered enormously. I have also managed to be practical throughout my career.\n \nAs an established actor often working with newcomers, do you find yourself mentoring them, giving story inputs along the way? \n\nYes, I do. I try my best to unify my cast and crew in the pre-production process itself, ensuring things are smooth sailing even before we get on the floors. As far as other factors go, I am not one to toot my own horn and take credit for my input. Some do that and more power to them, but that is not my style.\n\nYou are working next on the prequel of your 2021 critically acclaimed crime comedy Raja Raja Chora. Could you speak a bit more about that project?\n\nThe film focuses more on the episodes of Raju as a thief, before he gets married. There are three short stories in the first film, narrated by Gangavva’s character. The prequel will focus on three stories and features me in three different looks. The prequel is going to be a VFX-heavy film, the cast is going to be entirely different but the team behind the camera is the same. \n  ",

There is a notable air of curiosity around a project when he is announced to be a part of it. Guru Somasundaram operates in an interesting space that sets him a cut above a typical supporting actor. There is a notable air of curiosity around a project when he is announced to be a part of it. His next, Bell, a medical thriller, is set to hit the screens on June 9.\n\n“Bell is not your typical medical thriller where the antagonists are the medical mafia. In fact, it is not about corporate villains or organ trafficking. In the olden times, we had vaithiyaargal (healers) who held secrets about vaithiya muraigal (medicinal practices). Bell is centered around these traditional practices,” says Guru Somasundaram, who reveals that he plays one such vaithiyar with a grey shade to his character. “Bell employs a number of fantasy elements in the story, but you cannot call it a full-fledged fantasy story.”\n\nDirected by R Vengat Bhuvan, Bell has an ensemble cast that includes Nithish Veera, Petter Raj, Jack Arunachalam, Kalki, and Durga.  \n\nGuru was lauded for his portrayal of the primary antagonist in the critically acclaimed Malayalam superhero film Minnal Murali (2021). When asked if he likes playing darker characters, he chuckles in response before elaborating.\n\n“After Minnal Murali happened I naturally got offered a lot of negative characters but it’s not like I go after them consciously. I love playing a wide range of characters but if I get offered the role of an interesting antagonist then I would do that as well,” shares Guru, who attempts to dispel the notion of him leaning towards antagonist roles by reminding us of his upcoming project, in which he plays the lead role. \n\nAlmost a year ago, it was announced that filmmaker Pa Ranjith will be producing his erstwhile assistant Dhinakaran Sivalingam’s debut directorial, which stars Guru in the lead role.\n\n“It is an interesting story that stages a social drama through the ‘hero’s journey’ of a common man. It portrays the struggles of a lower-middle-class wage worker and tries to speak about a very relevant social issue in the process,” says Guru, adding, “Our director Dhinakaran is a very good storyteller. The story is set around places in Chennai like Ambattur and Puzhal, and Dinakaran’s familiarity with the setting handled in the story is an added advantage to the film.” ",

      "description": "Actor Siddharth reflects on his two-decade stint in industry, direction dreams, taking up the commercial route with Takkar, and more Actor Siddharth’s Instagram handle is ‘World of Siddharth’ and his profile description reads, ‘Eat.Drink.Laugh.Repeat.’ Looking at his filmography, and his offscreen persona, it is clear that Siddharth is clearly happy in his own world. He exudes a magnetism that is a testament to his self-awareness. \n\nCompletely aware that he is stereotyped into chocolate boy roles considering his roles in films like Bommarillu, Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana, 180, Kadhalil Sodhappuvadhu Yeppadi, and more, Siddharth is constantly working around it. One such attempt is this week’s release, Takkar, directed by Karthik G Krish. “I didn’t want to become an action hero, but Takkar gave me a chance to play a believable one. In this film, my character, Gunz, is an angry young man who wants to make money.\n\n\n\nAt some point, he becomes an action hero, and I’m sure the audience will root for him,” the actor mentions. Interestingly, more than his character arc, it was his co-star Divyansha’s role that intrigued Siddharth first. “I can imagine my character existing even 25 years back, but this woman is completely different, and it became the X factor. She is unapologetic, and has her reasons to believe the world is a certain way. Be it her views on men or her disbelief in love, everything felt new. When she meets my character, who left his place to make money and is frustrated about failing, I found it interesting to know what happens between them.”  \n\nWhile the romantic layers were on point, Takkar also gave Siddharth the chance to explore action in his films, and interestingly, he equates it with doing a comedy film where the result lies in the audience’s belief in the world.  “Becoming an action hero is definitely hard, but with a taskmaster like Karthik, we could achieve the results. I have worked with 25 first-time directors but with all due respect, none have worked with me again. But with Karthik, we will be collaborating again” reveals Siddharth.\n\nFor Takkar, Siddharth trained with Vietnamese martial artists to ensure he performed stunts with flair. “It is important to learn the falling techniques, stand firmly after a stunt, and we trained each shot before recreating them. Learning such hardcore skills is completely new to me,” says Siddharth.\n\nIf his onscreen persona over the last decade defined his versatility, he became an important voice in real life after his opinions on matters concerning the nation became sought after. “I take my reputation as an actor, filmmaker, and human being very seriously. I don’t work for money and it is not my driving force,” says Siddharth, who is now currently away from Twitter, a place where he thrived, and of course, received trolling and backlash. “While I do voice out issues, I want to be known as an actor first and not hold the focus on my anger on burning issues. I need to take care of my priorities, and most importantly, I have to be happy and alive. Call it self-preservation, change of priority, or strategy, but I know that I am the same Siddharth even now.”\n\nAn actor, an activist, a producer, and an aspiring filmmaker, the multi-faceted Siddharth has only released a couple of films in the last four years. During this time, Siddharth has starred in two OTT series, Navarasa and Escaype Live, and has observed the reduced attention span of the audience. “Filmmakers like Adoor Gopalakrishnan had the command to make films as slow as possible. But now, even a three-second gap can distract an audience prone to multitasking. Now, we should form relationships with the audience right from the film’s conception to promotion, and even after its release.”\n\nWith Takkar releasing both in Tamil and Telugu, inadvertently the question of pan-India rises. One of the early movers of this phenomenon, Siddharth has dabbled across languages through his films right from his early days in cinema. “In 2000s, we used multiple clapboards and uttered the same lines in many languages. Dubbing the same film in other languages and giving one YouTube interview doesn’t make it pan-Indian. It’s an idea created by those in between the audience and filmmakers,” says Siddharth.\n\nWith Takkar finally hitting the screens, Siddharth brims with joy about the takkar of a time he will have in the foreseeable future with glorious films — Indian 2, Chittha, The Test — lined up for release. “In the next 18 months, six of my films will be released, and it will be my life’s best line-up. It will include films made on a 100-crore budget, commercial entertainers, new-age films, multistarrers, and more. We are also looking to phase out the releases to ensure one of them hits every three months,” he adds.\n\nWhile the actor Siddharth seems to be on an upward swing, the erstwhile assistant of Mani Ratnam continues to harbour direction dreams. “It has always been my dream, and to realise it, I have to stop acting for a year. I am sure I will never act while I direct, and I want to get to a position where I have achieved enough and can afford to take a break and return to acting after directing a film. With six interesting releases lined up, the results of my efforts will soon be there for all to see. But above all, I aspire to get the recognition, love, and respect that I deserve,” signs off a confident Siddharth. ",

      "description": "This weekly column details the fascinating encounters that often take place on the sets of a film. While filming for debut director Raja Gurusamy’s Kaadapuraa Kalaikuzhu, actor Kaali Venkat had to travel to Kallakurichi. From there the unit set out for the shoot location in a small village called Eduthavainatham. Kaali goes on to recall the fond memories he had at the spot. “The village people were very warm, welcoming and supportive. Whenever we had long shoots that extended to night, the panchayat head and the villagers invited us all to stay in their homes as it was too late to head back to Kallakurichi. Their hospitable nature, inherent simplicity and warmth are something I’ll always remember.”  \n\nShooting in the village was a pleasant experience for yet another reason. “The hamlet is surrounded by beautiful hills. So we got to experience different kinds of weather, from sunny days to cool nights and rains in between. After wrapping the shoot for the day, once we climbed up a hill and saw a breathtaking waterfall there. The surroundings were so relaxing that it felt like spending time at a hill station.”\n\nActing with his close friend and co-star \nMunishkanth was another memorable experience for Kaali. “ Apart from being his friend, I’m also Munishkanth’s biggest fan and I enjoy watching him perform. But that also means that it is very difficult to shoot with him. I just can’t control my laughter with him around. For a particular song shoot, I kept breaking into laughter seeing his get-up. After several retakes, director Gurusamy had no choice but to come and request me to somehow complete the scenes without laughing.”\n\nHowever, director Gurusamy was impressed with the duo’s onscreen chemistry. “While watching the film in the editing table, he observed a unique sync and chemistry  between us and he shared that he enjoyed it as a fan.”\n\nActor Muniskanth decided to go on a diet during the one-month shoot. “He turned vegetarian for a month and followed a fitness plan. So, every day we used to wear our walking shoes, do some exercises after the shoot, and walk back to Kallakuruchi,”  shares Kaali.\n\nThe daily 2-hour walk turned out to be the most enjoyable experience for them. “En route, we met people and chatted with them, some would get down from their bikes and click selfies. It was a very relaxing stroll, we both enjoyed our daily interactions with the public. After one month of dieting, Munishkanth threw a huge non-veg feast for our entire unit in the village. Though I have shot for multiple rural films, this shoot will always be special to me.” ",

      "title": "In Tamil, I pick quality over quantity, says Nikhila Vimal",
      "image": "",
      "description": "Por Thozhil seems to have come at the right time in Nikhila’s career, which is clearly on an upswing. Up next, she is starring in Mari Selvaraj’s Vaazhai. Nikhila Vimal made her Tamil and Malayalam debut around the same time in 2015-16. Since then, although she has constantly been seen in Tamil cinema, it was in Malayalam that she grew from strength to strength. In Tamil, despite starring alongside the likes of Sasikumar (Vetrivel and Kidaari), and Karthi (Thambi), Nikhila hadn’t yet made a similar impact in the collective consciousness of the audience. Then came first-time filmmaker Vignesh Raja with Por Thozhil.\n\n“When Vignesh narrated the script to me, I was aware that my screen space was comparatively lesser than that of Ashok Selvan and Sarath Kumar sir. However, the clincher for me was that my character had more scope than just dancing, singing, or being relegated to a romantic interest,” says Nikhila, who reveals that the importance of her role outweighed the screentime in the film, which not just received rave reviews but kept the cash registers ringing in many places.\n\n“When I heard the script I knew Por Thozhil will be widely watched and liked by the audience,” says Nikhila, who plays Veena, a data analyst with the police force who works along with investigating officers to update records and do background research on a case. In fact, Nikhila shares that Por Thozhil marks the first time she is playing a role that is remotely connected to being a police officer. “Preparing for Por Thozhil, I often wondered if the khaki would suit me.\n\nThankfully, Vignesh told me that I would just be wearing casual everyday wear because I was only an assisting officer,” says Nikhila. While the khaki conundrum was solved, there was one other colour problem that cropped up. “I had brown streaks in my hair. So we spent a lot of time thinking if we should make Veena a girl with a mean brown streak, or dye it back to black. After much deliberation, we went with black hair.”\n\nWhile there is no doubt that Por Thozhil is one of 2023’s most-lauded Tamil films, one common criticism levied against the film was the lack of depth in Veena’s character. While she is introduced as a graduate of Massachusetts Insititute of Technology (MIT), who chose to take up this job to work for her country, there is very little that comes off this seemingly important character description.\n\nHowever, Nikhila is quick to point out that there was clear reasoning for all her actions, but it met a worthy adversary... the edit table. “Veena’s father is a data analyst, and after his demise in service, the job is assigned to her. Once Veena takes it up, she starts understanding the nature of the job, and how it is of national importance. But it was chopped off in the post-production,” explains Nikhila, adding, “In fact, parents impacting the child’s career choice is a common theme between Veena, Prakash (Ashok Selvan), and Loganathan (Sarath Kumar).”\n\nAlthough a Malayali, Nikhila is an actor who insists on dubbing for all her characters, including Por Thozhil’s Veena. “I have been fluent in Tamil for a while now. I can confidently say I can speak better Tamil than a lot of other non-Tamil actors in the industry. I learnt Tamil out of my love for it, and I even know how to read and write the language,” asserts Nikhila, who is glad that Por Thozhil has put the focus on her acting potential.\n\n“It has been so long since I did a Tamil film, and I’m glad Por Thozhil is the film that brought me back. I know the film has reached a huge proportion of the Tamil audience. I have been receiving relentless calls from my colleagues in the Malayalam film industry. In fact, many of them didn’t even know I was part of the film because the posters predominantly featured Ashok and Sarath sir. Considering the success of the film in Kerala, I have been overwhelmed with the responses coming my way,” shares Nikhila. \n\nPor Thozhil ends with a hint for a sequel, and with the Prakash-Loganathan duo moving on to the next case, one can’t help but wonder if Veena would join them on their next investigation, albeit with more to do this time around. While Nikhila hasn’t really given thought to what’s in store for her in the Por Thozhil universe, she does believe there is a possibility of the trio reuniting. “Probably, there will be more cases that will feature the trio. Possibly, the dynamics of the relationship between Veena and Prakash might also be explored. But one thing is clear... Por Thozhil’s focus will always be on the investigation.” \n\nPor Thozhil seems to have come at the right time in Nikhila’s career, which is clearly on an upswing. Up next, she is starring in Mari Selvaraj’s Vaazhai. “The moment I got the call for Vaazhai, I knew I had to do the film. Although my role in the film is as limited as that in Por Thozhil, I can assure you that it is a significant role that will have a lot of importance.” \n\nComing back to her seemingly limited presence in Tamil, Nikhila exhibits a clear vision of her career. “When it comes to Tamil Cinema, I have the option of picking only the best scripts. Since I am already doing a lot of Malayalam films, I don’t have the pressure of ‘I have to do a Tamil film now.’ When it comes to Tamil, I pick quality over quantity. I want to be known as a versatile actor in Tamil cinema, and essay roles that will earn me respect.”  ",

      "title": "Pride Month: Love, queer and beyond",
      "image": "",
      "description": "As we march past Pride month, let’s take a moment to understand queer representation in Tamil cinema, how romance is elemental in telling their stories, and the importance of looking beyond stereotype A month ago, Tamil anthology Modern Love Chennai, featuring six love stories, was released. The series represented various romantic setups that were age-defying, broke familial frameworks, brushed past economical backdrop, and a lot more. However, it lacked one aspect. Despite the varied circumstances of the stories, the colour remained the same. They were all tales of cisgender heterosexuals. Just when we seem to be moving forward, albeit in small steps, through stories like Natchathiram Nagargiradhu and Peranbu, has Tamil Cinema done enough to showcase the spectrum of characters out there?\n\nAs we march past towards the end of Pride Month, actor Anjali Ameer, known for her performance as Meera in Peranbu, says, “We are yet to get more opportunities. The majority of roles are either designed to be for a man or a woman. A queer person can be shown in any way and as I speak, I am also doing a few cisgender roles. As an artist, it should become normal for me.” Echoing the same, filmmaker Malini Jeevarathinam says that it is high time the industry sees queerness as a rightful act more than a content business. “Filmmakers can discuss with consultants and those from the community, and can see how much effort they have put into it, rather than seeing it just as a business.\n\n\nKalidas Jayaram (Thangam)\n\n\nA team’s ethics will be reflected in their films,” says Malini, who has worked as a script consultant in the upcoming Kaadhal Enbadhu Podhu Udamai, which talks about a lesbian relationship. Malini also worked as a ‘sensitivity radar’ where she sat during the initial discussions of Sudha Kongara’s Thangam (Paava Kadhaigal) and gave inputs regarding the queer angle and portrayal for the segment. Recalling an incident from a few years back, Malini says, “A section of audience and branding are showing queer solidarity, which in a way is healthy. Once I was not allowed to try clothes on from the men’s trial room and was constantly referred to as ma’am while I kept asking them not to misgender me. There was no hesitation in finding my comfort when they were ready to bill me in thousands for the clothes I buy. So coming from here, to finding crews with ally-ships, it’s an upward trend.”\n\nA romantic gesture\n\nFor Tamil cinema, which pretty much stays loyal to genres, romance has been one of them. But where are the queer romances? Pointing out Neeraj Ghaywan’s Geeli Puchi segment that brilliantly encapsulated queerness and casteism, and the empathetic portrayal of lavender marriages in Badhaai Do, Anjali feels that the south industry is definitely lagging behind in terms of representation. “We need to build conversations and an ecosystem for that, in the south. Filmmakers like Onir are now coming up with such stories. I think if we want stories of us, we have to come forth to tell,” she adds.\n\nTheatre director Srijith Sundaram, who runs Kattiyakkari Theater Group which stages plays on themes of sexual-gender minorities, social oppression, and comprises of artists and crew from queer community, feels that incorporating queer people will only elevate the stories. He recalls a tender moment of representation in Bombay in which a transwoman saves a child from a riot. “It was a beautiful scene, but that’s about it and we are yet to see mainstream storytelling with these characters.”\n\nSrijith also points out the responses to Deepa Mehta’s Fire which featured a homosexual romance between Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das. “The theatres were vandalised when the film came out. It was mainly because many saw the film as a disruptor of an ‘ideal’ family structure. Anything that questions or challenges the existing system is targetted. Looking back, we might have characters exhibiting asexuality or bisexuality, which we might have bracketed as socially awkward or assigned them ‘friend’ roles. I am curious to see how such orientations will be shown in cinema,” says Srijith. \n\nTrans rights activist and actor Living Smile Vidya also thinks that queer romance is dire in Tamil cinema as she talks about reimagining famous romantic tunes of Ilaiyaraaja, with queer relationships. As she lays hopes on upcoming artists and musicians to recreate that, she believes that it can create a ripple effect in a positive way. “I only hope to have a film or a song that represents my love,” says Vidya with a smile. \n\nOTT, a safe haven?\n\nMany feel that OTTs can be a safe haven to showcase stories from the queer community, especially with the privilege of private viewing creating a safe space.\n\nFilmmaker Rafiq Ismail, whose Rathasaatchi premiered on Aha, opines that as much as theatres are looking for content that “sells”, so are the OTTs. “It is all about the reactions of the audience. If we can reach them about the importance of queer representation, I think it would result in more such content coming up. Popular mainstream filmmakers could use their power and reach to impact a change.” \nMalini also reveals that a handful of queer-friendly projects are coming up. As they will be marking their debut as an actor in Nandhini JS’ upcoming project, Malini expects more queer representation onscreen soon on different platforms.\n\n\n\nNatchathiram Nagargiradhu\n\n\n\nWho can be the face?\n\nA debate on who are the rightful takers for queer roles has been ongoing, with the majority feeling that an ally’s caste, gender or orientation should not be considered for casting.\n“Even as trans people act in my plays, I don’t make their characters also be one. It is the audience’s choice to interpret. A family can have homosexual people as well, and still manage to co-exist without their sexuality being a barrier to a close familial bond. Even queer characters are played by heterosexual people only, which can change,” says Srijith.\n\nFairly pointing out how the cinema industry is still predominantly run by and for men, Vidya pins her hope on how women representation has managed to break through the shackles. With more queer people finding their footing behind the camera, on-screen inclusivity will be propelled further. “As an audience also, only queer people keep fighting for portrayal. A wave of thought has to come among the public as to why we are yet to talk about queer stories. Given we have had enough tokenism, now I want to see more of right and important representation. We are beyond tragedy. As much as efforts are put in making a cisgender person act like a trans woman, the vice versa can also happen,” Vidya explains as she takes the example of Pa Ranjith’s evolution from portraying a heterosexual love story (Attakathi) to love barring genders (Natchathiram Nagargiradhu).\n\nAnd if queer representation can also break through shackles, and find not just a breathing space but an expanse of sky to fly in, you never know... it is not just romance that will be in the air. Anjali’s hopes of playing a Queen or a top-level politician might not be just a pipedream, but just another day in the life of a queer actor. ",

      "image": "",
      "description": "Director Mari Selvaraj, whose Maamannan is all set for release, speaks about political motivations, animal metaphors, rural films and world music, and of course, reimagining Vadivelu There are filmmakers who make their careers by belonging to a system, and then, there are those who come in like a storm, sweeping everything in their wake. Mari Selvaraj is only two films old, but you can already feel the impact of an auteur at work. His cinema is strong and informed in its politics and imaginative and compelling in its craft. His is a film voice for the oppressed, booming in its conviction and irresistible in its persuasion. He arrived with Pariyerum Perumal; he broke ground with Karnan; and now, he’s expected to stretch boundaries with Maamannan. Here’s the filmmaker in conversation about his third film that’s getting released today:\n\nA lot has been said about your comments on Thevar Magan. You have said that your own views about cinema, including this film, have been reshaped over the years, based on your evolving understanding of society.\n\nThe decision to work in director Ram’s office has transformed my views about literature, cinema and society. Had I chosen to work with another individual, I might have continued to remain the star-struck kid who cared only about ‘commercial’ cinema. When I watched films like The 400 Blows and The Battle of Algiers, I began to see my life differently. I began to realise that my suffering wasn’t occurring in a vacuum; I saw that my life was inextricably linked to Tamil society and her people. This realisation drove me to create the art I do. The success of art, mine or anyone’s, isn’t about the number of people who experience it. It’s about what changes within them.\n\nWhile the quality of your first two films, Pariyerum Perumal and Karnan, provides enough justification to feel excited about Maamannan, it also helps that you have cast Vadivelu against type.\nI have always associated him — and the innocence in his roles — with my appa. You will see that my films will always speak of the parent-child relationship. I cannot imagine a story which doesn’t explore this relationship. At a time when I had no friends, no social life, my appa and amma travelled with me, protected me, ensured that I didn’t get into trouble… I didn’t realise this at the time, but now, I see that they have always radiated majesty. As a child, I kept asking why my appa, who was a therukoothu kalaignar, wasn’t like other fathers, but I now realise that when my parents protected me at the cost of coming across as meek, they were being braver beyond my imagination. You see this quality coming across even in Pariyerum Perumal — when the protagonist realises that true valour isn’t about beating up people. It’s about empathy; it’s about integrity.\n\nSo, you will know how much it means to me that Vadivelu plays a version of my father. Think about the comedy tracks he has done. He suffers, he cries, he gets beaten up, he gets neglected and trampled, he’s isolated… His reactions, however, make us laugh. I have always seen him as one of us, a common man at the receiving end of injustice. I might have laughed, sure, but my tears weren’t entirely of laughter. In fact, I have a portrait of Vadivelu and Ilaiyaraaja in my bedroom. I consider it a personal milestone to have worked on a film with him. In Maamannan, he suffers like he always does, but I’ve changed how we react to it.\n\n‘If my films are dismissed as caste cinema, then my art must get better’\n\nWas it hard to extract a subtle performance from Vadivelu, given all the years of theatricality and exaggerated responses?\nThankfully, I’m so attuned to his facial features that I can rein in even the slightest excess in performance. Every actor, every individual, has a unique nature. A good performance is when the actor responds to a fictitious situation as they would in reality. For me, acting isn’t about transforming into another person. It’s about throwing yourself into unfamiliar situations and responding honestly. With Vadivelu, I only had to disassociate him from his cinema version. I wanted to see the real Vadivelu.\n\n\n\nWhile your life has moved you from village to city, your films continue to be about rural life and the oppression there. Does urban life not interest you as much—or are there just too many stories from your village to be told?\nI don’t see a distinction between both. Urban residents keep travelling to their hometowns. Chennai can never be my home. For me, it’s like the school we went to as a child. We might spend a lot of time there, but it’s not home. No person can afford to avoid their rural origins. Even those who are born and die in the city must connect with their roots sometime. This is why the psycho-thrillers in Tamil cinema fail to impress me. It seems to me that our psychopaths and sociopaths are still derived from European cinema. We must dig into our layers. We must reconnect with our origins.\n\nWhile I see tremendous political and artistic value in your films, some continue to dismiss your work as ‘caste cinema’. How must this simple dismissal be tackled? \nEach person has their own prism through which they experience art. I shouldn’t forget that I too was prone to simplistic conclusions, that I too experienced films through its stars, that I too fought over actors and flung stones at theatre screens. Patience is paramount when you make the films I make. If Pariyerum Perumal and Karnan transformed only a dozen people, that’s quite all right. Perhaps ten years later, that number might increase. If certain sections dismiss my cinema without acknowledging its craft value, I must process it as a challenge. I must learn to make my art more accessible. I must put in more work to win over my detractors.\n\nSo, you don’t really get frustrated when positive change doesn’t quite seem to happen swiftly?\nNot at all. So many well-meaning leaders have strived for years at the expense of personal freedom and security. If they expected to see swift change, they would have lost all spirit. In comparison, my work is just making movies. Even if someone feels progressive only during the duration of my film, that’s good enough for me.\n\nAnd then, there are those who believe, based on their experiences, that caste discrimination doesn’t really exist anymore.\nThere’s a world outside my experience, right? My own exposure to world cinema, for instance, is not even a decade old. If it’s true that we connect only to films that resonate with our life and experiences, why did I cry after watching The 400 Blows? Why did I spend a sleepless night after Hotel Rwanda? I cannot force someone else to empathise with the characters of my cinema. They must show the interest to search for such truth in the world. Art exists to fuel your desire to search for and understand people and ideas that you may otherwise never encounter or acknowledge. My life took me to director Ram, who, in turn, opened the doors and windows of learning for me. Perhaps something akin to this might happen to others as well, so long as they are open to being moulded.\n\nAR Rahman’s evocative song, ‘Jigu Jigu Rail’, is fascinatingly Western for a film like Maamannan set in a village.\nRahman sir expected that he would have to do an album like Kizhakku Cheemayile. He was surprised when I asked him for a track that might sound somewhat like Bob Marley’s ‘Zion Train’. I have always been clear that my stories are not meant only for those who are already familiar with them. I want someone in the US, China, or Russia also to experience and understand them. Our most effective tool when taking local stories to the world is music. Just like I enjoy ‘Zion Train’ so much, I trust that someone somewhere will enjoy ‘Jigu Jigu Rail’ and Maamannan.\n\nI also dearly enjoyed that memorable shot of Udhayanidhi Stalin holding a piglet at the end of the trailer.\n(Smiles) The pig is probably the most insulted creature in our society. I love it a lot; my family has raised pigs. I grew up hurting from the realisation that people branded us for raising pigs. People brand you based on the animals you co-exist with. They attach their opinion about a pig to their opinion about someone who raises it. The pig, like all other animals, is a regal, far-from-docile creature in the wild. We tamed and controlled and eradicated the true qualities of many animals for our benefit—and now, we insult them for being pale versions of what they once were. For me, the eyes of different animals speak volumes. That’s why I use them a lot in my cinema—be it the dog in Pariyerum Perumal or the donkey in Karnan. Maamannan is, in fact, a story about pigs. ",

      "description": "Speaking to Cinema Express about her upcoming film, Lakshmy claims this was her most experimental effort so far. The shooting of Are You Okay Baby, the upcoming Tamil film starring Samuthirakani, Abhirami, and Mysskin among others, has been wrapped up. The film is directed by Lakshmy Ramakrishnan.\nThe film is currently in its post-production stages.\n\nSpeaking to CE about her upcoming film, Lakshmy claims this was her most experimental effort so far. “I just wanted to tell a story and follow my heart. I did not bother about what genre I am making the film under, or target audience.”\n\nWhen asked about the genre, she adds, “This film cannot be categorised under any genre, but it has a mixture of crime, legal and family drama. We titled it Are You Okay Baby because it is about a baby. It is also a reference to the popular line said by Vijay Sethupathi in Naanum Rowdy Dhaan.” But the filmmaker clarifies that one should not misinterpret the film as a commercial entertainer alone based on the light-hearted tone of the title. “Our film has a socially relevant undertone and a plot point through which I would have debated the social and legal issues,” she says.\n\nLakshmy has also written the script and confirms that it is not based on true events. “It is inspired by real-life characters I’ve met as well as my own experiences and perspectives but it is fiction at the end of the day. The film is my dedication to the Tamil audiences of my talk show.”\n\nWith Samuthirakani and Abhirami playing the lead roles, the cast also includes Mullai Arasi, Mysskin, Murugaa Ashok, Aadukalam Naren, Pavel Navageethan, Robo Shankar, Vinodhini, Lakshmy Ramakrishnan, among others. While speaking about casting Mullai Arasi, Lakshmy says, “Since cinema is teamwork, you are often questioned about your choices. When dusky girls are cast, they reason that it might not work economically. With this film, I have chosen Mullai’s character to be earthier as a personality.”\n\nAre You Okay Baby was extensively shot in Chennai and Kerala. The music is scored by Ilaiyaraaja. Lakshmy reveals that there is only one song in the film, for which the lyrics are penned by the composer himself, with vocals by Shweta Mohan. “The song will transform you to a different era, It will have a nostalgic factor. The commitment and time frame of veteran technicians and their discipline is amazing.\n\nAfter hearing the story, Raja sir immediately composed and recorded the song. I did not have to worry about the song because it was ready when I was going for the shooting. His work for the climax portions is brilliant and no one can beat him when it comes to scoring emotional sequences,” Lakshmy says about working with Ilaiyaraaja.\n  ",

      "title": "Direction Dreams: Assistant Directors should be treated with respect",
      "image": "",
      "description": "This weekly column brings to you a promising assistant director, and their aspirations \n\n\n               K Vijay\n\n\nWhen did you realise cinema was your calling?\n\nI was an average student in school, I was worried  if I would make anything out of my own life. But if there was anything I was actually good at, it was at storytelling. My teachers and friends often lauded me for my narrative abilities. As an avid movie watcher, I felt cinema was the right step forward. But coming from a proper middle-class family, I was tuned to not think of cinema as a prospective career option. Since my father was a car driver, I grew up with the belief that cinema was not for someone like me. But I was steadfast to break my own belief that only so-and-so’s children could be part of cinema. With a viscom degree, and awareness about filmmaking courses, here I am...\n\nWhat have you learned from your directors?\n\nMy Brahmma.com director Purush Vijayakumar,  an erstwhile assistant of Mani Ratnam sir, knew how to never take pressure on his shoulders. I learnt how to keep things light, and not take things too seriously. Also, I learnt a lot of work on the run, as I was just one of 2 ADs, and we had to do literally everything.\n\nWhen working with Karthik G Krish, he gave me the bounded script of Takkar. Reading it, I had a particular vision in my mind, and to see what he made out of that same script taught me the importance of perspectives. I also learnt the significance of doing extensive location scouting to find the right locations. Also, he made me realise the weight of proper efforts, even if the end results are not always favourable.  \n\nWhat’s the oddest or most memorable thing you have seen or done as an AD?\n\nThe car chases in Takkar were a memorable experience. We had six days of shoot, and what made it even more exciting was that they were filmed in live locations. We were shooting it on the Kathipara and Meenambakkam flyovers. We had to take care of crowd management, ensure no vehicles came in between the shots, and the safety of the cast. We were even hanging on the sides of the cars to film the scenes. But looking at the output, everything felt worth it.\n\nWhat’s one area of filmmaking you had a tough time with, but are better at now?\n\nComing out of the institute, I wasn’t sure if I would even make it in the world of cinema. From there, getting back-to-back opportunities was a great confidence booster. In fact, I haven’t been rejected in any interview. It instilled the belief that true dedication can pave the way for success. Apart from directing, I also learned cinematography, editing, poster designing, graphics, etc.  \n\nWhat’s a change you wish to see in Tamil cinema?\n\nAssistant directors are technicians too, and I hope the industry treats them with that respect. Many of us are treated with a lot of disdain, and I hope that stops. Also, I feel it would be nice to see our names on the posters too. It is not like we are financially well compensated, so it would be a nice shot in the arm to have our names out there.\n\nWho would be the dream cast and/or crew for your debut project?\n\nI want to do a romantic-action film with Kavin. I think he is the next Sivakarthikeyan. He is currently taking the content-oriented route, but I think he will do good in the action genre. I would love to work with DoP Vaanchinathan and Art Director Udhay, who also worked in Takkar.\n\n\n\nFilms worked on: Bramma.com, Takkar, Vijay TV Reality shows (Super Singer, Kalakkapovadhu Yaaru)\n\nDirectors worked with: Purush Vijayakumar, Karthik G Krish\n\nMain responsibilities: Location scouting, Costumes and Makeup, Poster Design\n\n ",

      "description": "The principal cast and the directors of &#39;Sweet Kaaram Coffee&#39; talk about the evolving dynamics in a home, working with each other, and why the series is one unforgettable trip When one is interviewing six guests over a 20-minute time frame, it is a big deal if we can get more than one question aimed at them. At some point, we throw caution to the wind, and hope the guests share a warm camaraderie that helps the interview go smoothly. Thankfully, the conversation with Team Sweet Kaaram Coffee was a rather delightful experience where the actors — Lakshmi, Madhoo, and Santhy — were finishing each other’s sentences, and the directors — Swathi Raghuraaman, Bejoy Nambiar, and Krishna Marimuthu — seamlessly took over from the other’s answer.\n\nSitting on one end of a rather long line of chairs, it was daunting to hear veteran actor-filmmaker and National Award winner Lakshmi say, “Do you think I am like the grandma Sundari that you saw in the trailer of SKC?” Well, before yours truly could vehemently deny she has aged from her Kadhaiyalla Nijam days, she says, “I am a career woman, who is still thriving. Sundari is far from my real self, and that is why I wanted to do that role. Unlike me, who received the freedom I wanted, and took it when needed, Sundari missed out on a lot of things dear to her. Sundari is seeking the sense of individuality that was lost when she got married at 19. This search drives Sundari, and the story of Sweet Kaaram Coffee.”\n\nLooking at the rushes of the series, which is about intergenerational bonding between three women, it was fun to see a rare side of Madhoo. Agreeing to the observation, the actor, who makes her debut in the OTT space with this series, talks about her long-standing search for an appreciation of a particular type. “In my mind, I am a very funny person, who finds joy in every little thing around me. I’m slightly sad about that aspect not being explored in my characters. Here, I get to do a lot of timing comedy, and it is bolstered by the timing of my wonderful co-actors,” says the actor, adding, “In fact, when I asked my directors their favourite scene of mine from SKC, they chose a serious scene, or a passionate conversation. I think it gets lost in my serious performances, but I am very grateful to get the opportunity to be funny in SKC.”\n\nEchoing the importance of finding joy in the mundane, Lakshmi says, “All we are trying to say is that there is nobody worth losing a smile over. That is the essence of Sweet Kaaram Coffee.” Director Swathi has been involved in the series right from the scripting stage, and who better to talk about the reason for the inception of the series. “We wanted to break the idea of how it is unsafe for women outside their homes,” says the filmmaker, who has helmed episodes 2-4 of SKC, which is essentially about a road trip the three women take on one fine day to move away from the pressures of being within the ‘safe’ structures of family. However, such a series also runs the risk of being seen as male-bashing, and Madhoo succinctly says, “We are conditioned to take on certain roles. But women are breaking the barriers, and men have to adapt to the shift in dynamics.” Swathi puts forth an interesting insight. “It is not like all men have a sense of malice. It is conditioning all over again. Women have just adapted faster, and it is important to engage the men in the process of change.”\n\nAnd the men in the panel — Krishna and Bejoy — feel completely in tune with the vibe of the women and the series. “In SKC, the road trip is a metaphor that says every single person should live their lives to the fullest. It is all about communication,” says Krishna, who helms episodes 5-7. Known for his testosterone-laden films, Sweet Kaaram Coffee is definitely an interesting detour in Bejoy’s career. “It was a very conscious decision. But these women were quite a handful too,” says the filmmaker to peals of laughter in the panel. “Not sure whose luck it was, but all three of us were very much in tune with each other. There was no ego on sets, and the directors gave us the freedom to give our inputs too,” says Lakshmi. Agreeing to this assessment about the directors, Santhy, who is making her debut in Tamil with Sweet Kaaram Coffee, says, “Both Gulmohar and SKC deal with intergenerational conflicts. In the former, I am just an observer, while the latter has me experiencing those emotions. I was shooting for them in similar timelines. It was challenging but the directors had immense clarity. An actor’s battle is won when you have great directors.” ",

      "description": " For this film,  she had to deliver several pages of lengthy dialogue. Shooting for director Arul Ajith’s Idumbankaari was an interesting yet challenging experience for actor Sshivada. She started shooting for Idumbankaari just a week before the Covid lockdown. “They were mostly shooting Ramya Pandian’s portions till then and  I shot with Ramya for just one day, after which lockdown was declared. The main challenge for all of us was maintaining the same body weight for continuity, despite the uncertainty of shoot due to the pandemic,” says Sshivada.  \n\nHer baby girl Arundhati was a few months old at the time and Sshivada had gained a little weight during the delivery period. “ I play an NIA (National Investigation Agency) agent and so I had to look absolutely fit in my costume of tucked shirts and trousers. So, for the next schedule, I managed to lose some of the weight and got fit. But the lockdown situation made it quite tough to stay in shape all through.”\n\nFor this film,  she had to deliver several pages of lengthy dialogue. “In addition to the length, each line also had lots of crucial information. So while dubbing I had to be extra careful.  After the whole Corona gap,  recreating the emotion of the scenes and delivering my lines without missing out any crucial information was a challenge.”\n\nDuring one particular shooting schedule, Sshivada could not celebrate her baby Arundhati’s 2nd birthday. “I had shoot till 2 am on that day, so I couldn’t return home to cut the cake with my baby and the family. Also, because I had left home early for the shoot, way before she woke up, I hadn’t even seen her on her birthday. Though I got a bit emotional, I felt that when Arundhati grows up she will understand the importance of giving the fullest to the profession. We cut her birthday  cake the next day in the presence of close family members.”\n\nSshivada was grateful to director Arul Ajith and the team for taking extra care in scheduling her shoots as she had a baby at home. Impressed by  Arul’s working style she reveals, “Several late night shoots had to be completed on time as getting the same location for night shoot again was tough. But the director handled it all completely calm and composed. His planning and eye for detail were very commendable. Once he finished filming an entire scene involving many actors and lengthy dialogues in just one hour and the entire unit lauded his work.”\n\nlocation diaries\n\nThis weekly column details the fascinating encounters that often take place on the sets of a film ",

      "description": "Tarun Teja, who made his directorial debut with Asvins, talks about what makes for a good horror film, importance of sound design,getting inspired by The Shining, and the joy of theatrical experiences Horror is a seminal genre, with a clearly perceptible intent. Above the layers of themes, plot intricacies, and character evolutions, a horror film has to excel at one major element above all else; making the audience feel the thrill of fear.\n\nAsvins, the latest Tamil horror film has done just that, and the critical and commercial acclaim stands testament to the same. Director Tarun Teja, who made his debut with Asvins, seems to understand the central allure of the horror genre very well. “Just like how a comedy film’s primary aim is to make the audience laugh, a horror film must make the audience feel fear.” \n\nAsvins strikes this fear right from the first scene. The film opens with 20 minutes of uninterrupted jump scare sequences. While a traditional approach would have a horror film slowly ramping up to its spooky elements, Tarun opts to open the film by pushing the audience along with the central characters into a mansion drenched in darkness, followed by a haunting replete with jumpscares. “I wanted the audience to be psychologically prepared for the film. I thought opening the film with an intense scene might help set the tone,” he says.\n\nA number of elements have to work in perfect harmony for the film to transpose this fear onto the audience. The chiefest of which is the performance of the actors. The director reveals how every actor went through an extensive acting workshop to prepare for their roles.\n\n“If you observe the first half of the film, most of the scary elements, like the sounds, are non-diegetic, the actors had to imagine most of the things and react accordingly. I used to sit with the actors during the workshop to explain what I wanted to see on the screen. The basic intent was to carry the primal emotion, fear, onto the minds of the audience.”\n\nAnother element that played a crucial factor in the success of the film is the stellar sound design. “I developed the scenes based on sounds,” he says, before elaborating, “I wanted low-frequency vibrations and I was clear about the kind of reverbs I wanted. There are two different realms in this film and I differentiated them based on sounds. I also wanted the music to be atmospheric. There are places where you hear isolated whispers and sounds. It was all planned from the scripting stage.” Tarun’s extensive knowledge of sound design comes from his background studying noise and vibrations in Germany. That is perhaps why he understands and feels immense pride in the depth of work done by his sound mixer Harish. As a proponent of not revealing the ghost until later in the film, Tarun says he used the sound to allude to the demonic entity’s presence throughout the film. “Sound is my weapon. Every department from sound to cinematography works to add to the depth of storytelling. That’s how you not just watch but feel the horror,” he puts it succinctly. \n\nApart from these controlled elements, factors like location and time constraints also helped influence the making of the film. He says, “When we hunted for location and came across the mansion, we had limited time to film so everything had to be planned on paper well before we started rolling the camera.”\n\nInterestingly, the mansion also helped him draw inspiration from Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining. “When my production team showed me the mansion and the island it is set in, I immediately remembered the opening scene of The Shining. We see the family driving to this isolated hotel in this gorgeously stretched-out helicopter shot. The scene stretches for so long to show us how the characters are going to this remote place, it makes you feel like they might never return from this place. The scene in the beginning of Asvins where we see the characters going to the mansion, is an homage to the opening scene in The Shining.”\n\nWith all eyes on what he has to offer next, Tarun claims that he’s a big fan of thrillers. While he has not yet settled on the story for his sophomore effort, he asserts that whatever he does next will be a complete theatrical experience. “You can’t feel the vibrations in a laptop or a cellphone. Theatrical experiences are what cinema is all about. Moreover, Tamil cinema audiences love watching films in theatres. I will work to give them a complete theatrical experience” he signs off with excitement.\n\n ",

      "description": "With Tamil cinema witnessing a slew of delayed releases in recent times, let’s hear from members of the film fraternity about its impact on their respective careers and more Over the past couple of years, one thing that has been common in Tamil cinema has been the slew of delayed releases finally hitting the theatres. In just the past two months, films like Takkar, Bommai, Yaadhum Oore Yaavarum Kelir (YOYK), Raavana Kottam and Kasethaan Kadavulada hit theatres after being in the cans for a long time.\n\nWhile the pandemic was a major hindering force, it cannot be named as the sole reason for the deferral of these films, which were also stuck due to production issues. However, what is common is the heterogeneous impact that affected the assorted mix of people involved in a project, including the director, producer(s), actors, and technical crew.\n\n“Delays are very common in the industry, and it is definitely not under our control. Taramani was released 3.5 years after we began production. Rocky was delayed due to the pandemic,” says actor Vasanth Ravi, who is now grateful for the lineup of films he has coming up, including Jailer. But this level of pragmatism isn’t something that is common with all the players in this issue.\n\nThe hampering catalysts\n\nPointing out that the pandemic caused the first obstruction, director Venkata Krishna Roganth who made his debut with YOYK explains that the producers’ decisions were also catalysts. “If everything went well, the film, which began production in 2019, would have been released latest by December 2020. While COVID-19 accounted for 25 per cent of the delay, the investment made by the producers, their hesitation to proceed with the project and the advice they received for the same, caused the remaining 75 per cent,” he adds.\n\nDirector Sri Ganesh, who had a hit debut with 8 Thottakal in 2017, had a setback after the postponement in production of his sophomore, Kuruthi Aatam. The film, which was launched in 2018, and finally hit the screens in 2022. “The main reason for the production delay was financial difficulties. Of course, there are also other undisclosable factors.”\n\n\n\nStumbling through production\n\nThe woes of those involved in a film project do not miraculously vanish once the shooting gets back on track. Shanthnu Bhagyaraj, who resumed shooting for Raavana Kottam 1.5 years after the first schedule, says that maintaining the look for the film was the biggest challenge. Meanwhile, Roganth had a different set of problems as his film had war sequences set in Sri Lanka. “Everything had changed by the time we returned for the shoot, almost 250 days later. We were pushed to shoot the Sri Lanka war flashback portion in 3 to 4 days, as opposed to the original 8 days schedule that we had planned,” reveals Roganth, adding that the rushed schedule definitely affected the quality of the film.\n\nEchoing this sentiment, Sri Ganesh observes that nine out of ten times when a film is delayed, the technical quality of the film is directly affected. “The release of Kuruthi Aatam was finalised at the last minute. A lot of visuals and editing were incomplete. I felt helpless as most of the edits were not in my hands.”\n\nThe post-production paradox\n\nWhile the challenges of actors and directors are complex, they are also documented. However, the technical crew’s efforts during such instances are often overlooked.Music composer Nivas K Prasanna is an unfortunate recipient of such ill luck. While some of his films —Takkar, YOYK — saw the light of day, projects like Sumo and Kallapart are still awaiting release. “Music is as time-sensitive as content. Every six months, music and audio technology get updated, and the music or score for a film has to be updated accordingly,” says Nivas, adding, “When delayed the director’s mind also sometimes changes.  Also, I have to mention that I didn’t always get paid for these reworks. Yet, our time is used up and I couldn’t commit to any other film.”\n\nThe Impact on career and mental health\n\nPor Thozhil-fame actor Nikhila Vimal, who has only had 7 Tamil releases in 7 years says that postponed releases have made her more picky about the films she does in Tamil. “Over the years, my script-choosing process has also started involving the thought of whether or not the film will have a timely release,” she explains.For Sri Ganesh, the postponement and sudden release of Kuruthi Aatam also took a swing on his mental health. “I was emotionally very affected after the release of Kuruthi Aatam. It took time for me to come out of it.”\n\nNivas also faced similar psychological issues, so much so that he had the good mind to quit the music industry, altogether. “Mentally, I could not work on other films because, at the back of my mind, there was a constant reminder that a part of my work is unreleased. At a point, I even considered giving up music composition and taking up a different field altogether,” he says.\n\nA producer’s perspective\n\nWhile producers of many of these films were not very open to comment upon the reasons behind the deferral in production, we reached out to an important voice from their end — producer PL Thenappan and former Vice President of Tamil Film Producers Council. “Producers who are relatively new to the game may miscalculate the budget required for a film. Then, they are forced to pause production of the film until they can come back with finances to continue it.”\n\nThenappan also observes that directors may also be accountable for production delays. “Sometimes, the director would say a certain budget is enough for the film. Yet, due to the addition in the story or unforeseeable circumstances like weather changes, their schedules would go on and on. The producers are then forced to bring in more money to back the film, for which they need time.”\n\nWhile we speak about delayed releases here, there are some films that are still languishing in production hell, including Naragasooran, Sathuranga Vettai 2, and Garjanai, among others.It is important to note that most of such films are either the debut films of aspiring filmmakers or starring up-and-coming actors. The consequence a delayed release can have on a budding talent may be manifold, and at times, unrecoverable. While this might not be the last time we see delays, for whatever reason, affecting a film and all its players, all we can hope for is a future where everything goes according to plan. Hopefully. ",

      "description": "Back after a hiatus with O.Baby, the brain behind popular films such as Meesa Madhavan, Photographer, Naran,  reveals his maverick mind in interaction with TNIE Ranjan Pramod is a bundle of raw energy and aggression. His passion for cinema is palpable as he gushes on the art of filmmaking. Back after a hiatus with O.Baby, the brain behind popular films such as Meesa Madhavan, Photographer, Naran, Achuvinte Amma, Ennum Eppozhum, Rakshadhikari Baiju Oppu reveals his maverick mind in interaction with TNIE\n\nWho was Ranjan Pramod before Randam Bhavam? Do you have a film school background?\nYes. I studied editing at Adyar Film Institute (now MGR Government Film and Television Training Institute). After that, I assisted filmmaker Rajiv Menon for a couple of years. Then I did a lot of advertising films. And that was my learning ground.\n\nWhen you entered feature films, why didn’t you continue with editing?\nSee, editing is a film’s grammar, and shots are its alphabet. That is why I went to study editing, not because I wanted to be an editor. I don’t think I have the patience or the concentration for the job. Even when I’m directing, I will only watch the video after a basic layout is readied by the editors. I’ll give all the pointers for it.\n\nHas your editing background helped you as a filmmaker?\nOf course. I realised very early that understanding editing will help the filmmaking process. Every director and writer should also be an editor. We should know where to call a cut and where to start again. In my opinion, if anyone wants to study filmmaking, they should start with editing.\n\nWhere did you get the guidance or inspiration to study in a film institute?\nI used to watch all the classics that appeared in Doordarshan. Then there was Odessa, the film collective formed by John Abraham. He had already left when I joined, but members were allowed to take films with them and watch at their leisure. This exposure to good movies was a great help. When I get curious about something, I aggressively chase it. This aggressiveness has definitely helped me in my younger years, especially during the learning period.\n\nYou entered the industry as a writer with Randam Bhavam, not as a filmmaker. What was the reason for it?\nActually, I was planning to direct a film in Tamil titled Mazhai Vara Poguthu with Ajith and Juhi Chawla. But that’s when a long strike hit the industry, and the film had to be dropped. I was working on this film for over two years, and it got called off just before the commencement of the shooting. It took a toll on me and pushed me into depression. Later, it was my friendship with Lal Jose that brought me to writing. Actually, I never planned to be a writer, nor was I planning to enter Malayalam cinema.\n\nWas it your meeting with Juhi Chawla that led to the offer to direct a Shah Rukh Khan film?\nYes. I was in Mumbai to meet Juhi Chawla for the narration. It was writer Robin Bhatt who picked me up from the airport. Before dropping me back, he invited me to his office and asked whether I wanted to do the same film in Hindi with Shah Rukh and Juhi in the lead. And I was in a conundrum. It was a huge opportunity. But as I had already committed myself to another project. I politely refused \nRobin’s offer.\n\nWhy weren’t you keen on doing Malayalam films?\nBy the time I was writing for Randam Bhavam, I had forgotten quite a bit of Malayalam. I felt Tamil cinema was my playground. I thought of returning to Chennai after Randam Bhavam. However, the film faced a setback at the box office, and I felt defeated. Lal Jose and I desperately wanted to deliver a hit, and that’s how Meesa Madhavan happened. After its success, I was definitely about to leave Malayalam cinema. That’s when Sathyan Anthikad approached me, and I couldn’t say no to him. How do you say no to a director like Sathyan Anthikad? That’s how Manassinakkare was born.\n\nHow did you cope with Randam Bhavam’s box office failure?\nTwo days before the film’s release, we organised a preview in Chennai, which was attended by all the big names in Malayalam cinema. They all loved the film and heaped praise. But things changed when it was released in theatres. I was shattered. Later, Ajith happened to watch the film, and he liked it. He wanted to remake it in Tamil, but I didn’t want to revisit it. Today, I see many raving about the film, but I don’t feel any excitement. I don’t even wish to remember the film or its experiences.\n\nYou said ‘no’ to Shah Rukh Khan and Ajith’s films. Have you ever regretted these decisions?\nWell, I do during my days of struggle. But I mostly feel happy about myself. What’s important to me is my integrity. At the end of the day, I’m living for myself and not for others. Those who want to stand with me can do so, others can leave. That’s my attitude.\n\nWill there be a film with Ajith in the future?\nIf somebody is ready to coordinate, then definitely, yes. I wanted to do a film with Ajith even before he became a big star. That’s only because I saw a lot of potential in him. Unfortunately, that hasn’t been fully tapped yet. The Ajith we’re seeing today is a star who designed his career according to the market needs. If I get to do a film with him now, I might be able to show a different side of him. But I don’t think I have the perseverance to pursue something like that now. Forget doing a film, it would be a herculean task to even meet him now. \n\nAfter Achuvinte Amma came Naran, which is widely regarded as one of your best works...\nJoshiy sir, who visited Achuvinte Amma sets for some reason, barged into my room and said, “You have to write a movie for me”. I couldn’t say no because, like Sathyettan, Joshiy sir was a filmmaker I adored. Actually, I was planning to direct Naran with Lalettan. But I thought I’ll direct my film after working with Joshiy sir and giving the script to him. \n\nYou always wanted to make films that pull the audience to theatres. Did you think a film like Photographer could bring in the crowd?\nI certainly did. The only thing is, the film happened to be different from people’s expectations. When Naran became a hit, people expected something similar. But, Photographer was like a docu-fiction. My priority wasn’t commercial success but documenting the Muthanga incident. \n\nIn my own land, my government used guns against our own aboriginals, our tribals. As far as I know, such an incident hasn’t happened anywhere in the world. I felt like there would be no meaning to my life, both as an artist and filmmaker, if I didn’t document it.\n\n‘If you want to cross borders, forget comedy’\n\nWhy did you take a long break after Photographer?\nWell, the kind of movies I wanted to make were different. I grew up watching classics like Electra, and I couldn’t do anything that matched those films. At that time, the Malayalam industry was in a primitive state; it still is. I knew my approach should differ from what the industry was doing then. That was how I treated Photographers. But while doing it, almost the entire crew was against me as they considered my approach wrong. I realised the atmosphere wasn’t suitable for me then and decided to take a break. 5-6 years later, my friend and actor Vijayan Peringode asked me to return to the industry as times had changed. Now that friction is absent. People understand that I’m attempting something different, unlike earlier when people treated me like I’m completely ignorant.\n\nJust like Randam Bhavam, Photographer also received a late acceptance...\nMy films have that shelf value. That realisation helped me to come out of the depression caused by Photographer. I realised that we cannot expect a good response at the time of release itself. It may have an impact on the future as well. I think such expectations are barriers to a good work of art. The lifetime of a cinema is much longer. The real audience of the film would come later. Even now, I receive good messages about those films. But it doesn’t excite me. Because I am my biggest critic.\n\nRakshadhikari Baiju was a critical and commercial success. What did you feel then?\nWhenever I complete a project, there’s a sense of satisfaction within me. But I am not stuck there. Rakshadhikari Baiju was a realistic film, and I am happy about how it turned out. Because one should have good command over the filmmaking language to do such a film. It is an achievement. But I have to do much beyond that. In the next 4-5 years, the coming generation, who have good exposure, will take Malayalam cinema to great heights.\n\nDo you think Malayalam filmmakers have to follow international cinema?\nYes. It is important to watch and study movies. In my opinion, if Malayalis start using our intelligence accurately, no one can surpass us. It’s clear that we haven’t reached where we could be. Though we are making around 200 films a year, we’re nowhere near Korean, Iranian, and Latin American films.\n\nWhat do you think is the reason for that?\nI think it’s because many of our contemporary directors copy whatever they watch in world cinema. That will make us inferior, no? We usually look at what others have rather than looking within. Also, we are the successors of Kunchan Nambiar, sarcasm is our forte. We have that innate I-know-it-all attitude.\n\nHow do you land on your subjects? What’s the excitement factor?\nI start thinking about the story only after the project is ready. I need to have an idea about the project. Manassinakkare happened when I accidentally saw a magazine’s cover with the headline ‘Sheela wants to come back’. It was a gorgeous black and white photo of her, and I kept wondering what costume would suit this beautiful woman now. At that moment, the song, ‘Kizhakke Malayile Vennnilavoru Christhyani Pennu’, struck me from nowhere. I imagined Sheela as Christian woman in a traditional chattayum mundum and that costume led me to the story.\n\nSimilarly, Achuvinte Amma was also born out of a simple thought. Sathyettan asked me, “How would it be if Urvashi and Meera Jasmine played mother and daughter?”. I thought it was an interesting combination but wasn’t sure if Urvashi would agree. Sathyettan assured me that he has already got her nod. But he was quick to add that there shouldn’t be a big difference between this mother and daughter. The immediate question I asked was, “Oh then, they aren’t real mother and daughter?”. From that question, the film was born.\n\nIn the case of Ennum Eppozhum, Antony Perumbavoor asked me if I can script a film for Sathyan Anthikad. During the initial discussions, Manju Warrier’s name wasn’t there. After the release of How Old Are You? there were talks about Manju planning to be active in cinema. That’s when we thought of working out a Mohanlal-Manju Warrier-Sathyan Anthikad combination. The next challenge was to zero in on a subject that could fit in both Mohanlal and Manju Warrier with equal prominence. Manju had a certain image at that time, which meant we couldn’t make them a romantic pair. We knew people would jeer the moment these two say, ‘I Love You’. So we conceived the last scene first—the moment romance blooms, the film ends. We kept bouncing ideas, but couldn’t land on a story. After a few days of struggle, I realised that I had the story within me; it was just that I wasn’t able to see it. That’s how Lalettan’s character in the film was born —a lazy writer whose career is at stake has to write a story on Manju Warrier. To make it more dramatic, I made the female lead a divorcee fighting for her daughter’s custody.\n\nFor Rakshadhikari Baiju, I wanted to do something that I hadn’t done before. I wanted it to be a new experiment. I am not competing with anyone. I knew that I had to do it with whatever resources I had. Many were not accepting my ideas and I didn’t have a hit background as well. So I decided that it would be an art with whatever resources I had.\n\nComing to your latest film, what’s O Baby about?\nIt is a drama thriller. It has action, adventure, romance and drama. It is a package like any other film of mine. But I am presenting it differently so that the audience will not recognise it as a package. I am trying to break that package.\n\nWhen did the idea of a thriller come up?\nJust like any other story idea. But if someone tells me I can’t, then I will be trying my best to make it work. You should have a problem first, then it will be easy.\n\nWho challenged you that you cannot do a thriller?\nMyself. Because I have done feel-good and comedy films. But mostly, action films have a market value. Then we will be noticed by stars and heroes. Though Rakshadhikari Baiju was a hit, nobody from other industries took up the movie. Comedy films are regional. If you want to cross borders, then you have to forget about comedy. Chaplin and all are an exception in this case.\n\nApart from being an actor, Dileesh Pothan is also a filmmaker. Did it help to have him headline and produce O Baby?\nTrust is very important in cinema and Dileesh had that in me. If he had said ‘no’, this project wouldn’t have happened. It’s a highly experimental film, and I don’t think I could’ve convinced any other actor to do it. Dileesh understood what I was trying to do because he’s a filmmaker himself. There’s also a lot of responsibility on his shoulders because he’s the only known face in the film.\n\nLike your earlier films, O Baby also has a lot of new faces. Do you think casting newcomers adds to a film’s freshness?\nIt’s true to an extent, but I’m not always particular about it. While working with experienced actors, they know what to deliver which makes my job a bit easier. But with amateurs, you should mould them differently. The good thing, though, is you get a lot of rawness. For Photographer, I cast a boy who didn’t have absolutely any idea about cinema. And imagine, this boy had to act with someone like Mohanlal. But interestingly, it was Lalettan who was finding it tough. He was struggling to match the boy’s raw energy. As a director, my job is to get them both on the same page, communicate my needs and get what I want.\n\nWhat kind of rapport do you share with Mohanlal?\nI’ve worked with him in three films (Naran, Photographer, Ennum Eppozhum), and I find it fascinating that he doesn’t need a lot of explaining. You just have to give him a brief, and he’ll understand the rest. People say he doesn’t prepare a lot, but I don’t think so. We usually go to shoot only 6-8 months after we first pitch the story idea. But even after all these months, he’ll have a clear idea about the character. So there’s some kind of preparation happening in his head, it might be conscious or subconscious. \n\nBut for that preparation to happen, the story idea has to be sown firm and deep in him. That’s our responsibility. Once that idea sprouts, he’ll take care of it. Lalettan might seem like a free-flying kite—having fun and making others comfortable. But beneath all that, there’s a lot of processing happening.\nMammukka has a completely different approach from Lalettan. Though I haven’t worked with him yet, I know his discipline and devotion to work. Unlike Lalettan, he’s particular about every little detail, which includes his look and costumes.\n\nSo is there a Mammootty project on cards?\nWe’ve been in discussions right from the time I was an assistant to Rajiv Menon. During the shoot of Randam Bhavam, actor Augustine approached me to script a Mammukka-Shaji Kailas film. Since I had no plans to continue in Malayalam cinema, I declined the offer. That refusal didn’t go well with Mammukka. There was a brief gap between us. But after the premiere of Randam Bhavam, he spoke with me and appreciated my work. Ever since then, we’ve been discussing several ideas but nothing worked out. He is an actor I adore and respect a lot, so I was keen on doing something substantial which will also excite him. Finally, things are falling into place now. Mammootty Kampany will be producing the film, but we haven’t finalised the dates or anything as it’s a big-scale project.\n\nDo you have any ambitious ideas in mind that you would want to make a film someday?\nThere has never been a dearth of ideas (laughs). One such is based on the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization. It’s a truth that nobody has spoken before and I would love to bring it to screen. But it’s a huge project, which would also ruffle a lot of feathers. I tried approaching a production house in Mumbai and they were even impressed with the idea. But when they pitched it to a few people, the response wasn’t very encouraging.\n\nYou recently said that no sane person would ever believe what’s being propagated through a film like The Kerala Story. Don’t you think films influence society?\nIt can, but I don’t think it means much. Such influence will probably result in a few votes, but I don’t think it’s a threat. The Kerala Story shows that a certain section of Muslims are out there with an agenda to trap women from other religions in the name of love, convert them, and take them to countries like Syria. I agree there have been a few cases, but this whole theory of trapping in the pretext of love sounds stupid to me. That’s why I said no one with an ounce of common sense would believe it.\n\n ",

      "description": "The actor-director discusses his widely-praised performance in O.Baby, the excitement of working with a like-minded filmmaker and more In the buildup to the messy climax fight in Dileesh Pothan’s directorial debut Maheshinte Prathikaram, the protagonist Mahesh Bhavana asks his assaulter Jimson, “Health okke okay ale?”. That’s exactly what I wanted to ask Dileesh after watching his latest release, O.Baby. The Ranjan Pramod directorial has Dileesh rolling over rocky terrains to pull off raw and dangerous action scenes. “Health is okay now (laughs). But I was at my fittest during O.Baby.\n\nThere was a 6-8 month-long preparation period as the character demanded me to be physically strong. Things were all fine until the climax fight’s shoot. With just two more days left to wrap up the film, I broke my leg and had to be on rest for nearly three months,” recalls Dileesh with a wry smile. \nBut all the pain seems to have finally borne fruits as Dileesh’s performance in the titular role has widely been lauded. Despite being at his self-effacing best, the actor-director elaborates on his acting process and the excitement of working with a like-minded filmmaker.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nEarlier while speaking with us, Ranjan Pramod spoke about how this project wouldn’t have happened if not for your trust. Where did that trust come from?\n\nI’ve huge respect for Ranjan sir and his works. It was after working with him in Rakshadhikari Baiju that I became serious about acting. Though it was a brief role, it gave me a big break—not in terms of my performance getting noticed, but how it influenced me personally. While watching it again during the pandemic, I felt like calling him to enquire why he didn’t do a film after that. That conversation initiated several discussions for the next few months and at some point, we landed on this idea. My trust was in Ranjan Pramod, the writer-director, and not the project.\n\nRanjan Pramod is known to be a fluid filmmaker like you, in terms of developing the narrative on the go and on-set improvisations. Does this similar approach make it easy for you to work together?\n\nIt’s definitely a comfort because it’s a technique I’m familiar with. More than that, Ranjan sir has a clear understanding of the medium and its possibilities. I’m particularly impressed with the way he moulds his actors and extracts the best out of them. I believe it’s because he develops deep layers for each character. You can see that with the quality of performances in his films.\n\nSpeaking of performances, many have rated this as your career best. What’s your personal assessment?\n\nAfter a film’s release, I respect whatever the audience’s response is. So if they say this is my career best, it must be true. For an actor to display his potential, it’s important that they get a full-fledged character. This is easily my most rounded character to date, and I believe I’ve done a pretty good job at it.\n\nBaby is a complex character lost somewhere between loyalty and servitude. How did you ease into him?\n\nAs someone who lives in this society and is aware of what’s happening around me, I could understand Baby and his psyche. Moreover, there were clear inputs from Ranjan sir. But it was only during the shooting that I identified and got to know him better. The character’s mental state is evolving, and with each scene, I felt like I was getting closer to him. That’s a process I really enjoyed.\n\nCould you walk us through the filming of the emotionally charged scene between Baby and Valya Muthalali just before the interval?\n\nI can explain what happened before the shot, but not during the shot because I still don’t know how it transpired. It’s the most crucial scene in the film, so whenever it came into discussion, there was a sense of fear growing in me. As per my request, we shot that particular scene only a few days after I became familiar with the character. Ranjan sir composed the scene in such a way that the camera mostly favoured me. I wasn’t instructed to cry but somehow during the shot, I got extremely emotional and shed tears. Sir was delighted with how the scene turned out and retained it in the film as such. Though we did go for a couple of more takes, I think he went ahead with the first take.\n\nBaby goes through a lot of such emotions that you might not have done earlier in any film. Like the action...\n\nYes, that’s why I believe this is the most full-fledged character I’ve been offered yet. The fights in this film had to be raw and violent. We didn’t want it to look choreographed, and Unni Perumal guided us with a basic design. It was a challenging terrain to perform such stunts, but we still gave it our all.\n\nYour previous directorial, Joji, was also set in a similar sprawling plantation area (rubber instead of cardamom). Did you pick any new lessons from Ranjan as to how to effectively explore such a landscape?\n\nAbsolutely, but I don’t know how to point out what exactly I learnt as it’s a subconscious process. I was with Ranjan sir right from the development process of O.Baby, then almost 60 days of shooting and another 30-odd days of post-production. All these days of being together and sharing ideas have helped me immensely. As a filmmaker, that’s what excites me about acting—the experience of working with senior directors, watching them up close, and learning their craft. Each filmmaker has a different vision and execution, and they all have influenced me in one way or the other.\n\nSince you’re a filmmaker yourself, do you ever feel tempted to give creative suggestions while acting?\n\nI think you don’t necessarily have to be a filmmaker to share your creative input. Even if you’re just a small part of the film, you would want to see it turn out well. So I always ensure that I share my thoughts and concerns, but the key is not to force them on anyone. It’s up to them whether to consider it or not. In that sense, Ranjan sir is a very receptive person who is all ears for suggestions.\n\nIs Dileesh Pothan, the actor, snatching a lot of time away from Dileesh Pothan, the filmmaker?\n\nNot really. Even while I’m busy with my acting commitments, I’m constantly in discussions for my directorial ventures. Syam (Pushkaran) and I are now working on something, and we hope to get it materialised by next year.\n\nAny plans to venture into scripting?\n\nI would love to script a film, but I’m sure I won’t be directing it. I prefer directing someone else’s script. It’s because I need someone to constantly bounce ideas and have discussions with. Having a writer by my side is comforting. ",

While Jai, a Pathanamthitta-based former fashion company executive, quit his job when cinema came calling, the Kollam-based Mahesh continues to work as a bank employee while pursuing screenwriting dreams. \n\nMadhura Manohara Moham isn’t a perfect film—the second half is relatively more interesting than the first—but picking the brains of screenwriters with different thought processes and expectations is an activity worth engaging in. Both Jai and Mahesh anticipated the varied responses to the film, and they concur with the assessment of the second half, in particular. That said, they held on to their confidence in what the second and third acts of the film had to offer. \n\n“We knew that some people would react in a certain way to the first half, but we also hoped that when audiences leave the theatres, the film’s latter portions, especially the ending, would linger in their minds for a while,” says Jai, who, along with Mahesh, looked to the format of successful mainstream entertainers such as, say, Drishyam for inspiration.\n\n“These films have this format where they take a while to establish the characters and setting in the first half. We could’ve integrated a pivotal element at the 20-min mark, but then the audiences might later feel that they’re being dragged. It is not, after all, a short film, and we had to consider the time duration management. There are those for whom the first half worked, and we are fine with both kinds of reactions.”\n\nAdding to Jai’s points, Mahesh recalls that the earlier drafts didn’t have the caste angle. He shares that the script presented opportunities for mining humour when they thought of a young woman who isn’t concerned with caste and religion having a mother and elder brother who feel the opposite. “It helps that Jai is familiar with the milieu, and when we discussed locations, placing this story in Pathanamthitta seemed a more logical choice,” he says.\n\n“And as for the reaction to the ‘aimless first half’, we expected mixed responses. We were perfectly aware that our story actually begins just a little before the interval arrives, and once it picks up from there on, it traverses a straight line till the end. One interesting element we brought in was having a particular character remain secondary in the first half, and becoming a dominant character when the twist occurs midway, whereas, in the first half, it’s someone else getting more screen time. After this development, audiences have something to look forward to.”\n\nWhen asked if they wrote the script with a family audience in mind, Jai replies that that wasn’t necessarily the case. “We knew it would work for them—that was a given—but we also thought of the possibility of some elements working for the youth audience. Most often, we see that family audiences increase in strength in the second week and third weeks as opposed to the younger audiences who watch these films on the initial days. So when we conceived this idea, we had an unbiased approach in mind.\n\nUsually, when we talk about gender equality, it’s always one-sided. After all, we are talking about the emotions of human beings in this film, and the consideration is that a character is a ‘human being’, not whether they are a man or a woman. I strongly feel we should stop discussing these things in terms of a ‘man did this’ or a ‘woman did that’ and reflect more on what human beings generally do. Not doing that can create unnecessary arguments. You know, I see my male and female friends the same way. For the content to look fresh, we should approach something from all angles.” \n\nSince Mahesh was an equal contributor, the writing process involved either of them developing a scene and then the other adding an element later to enhance it further. “It was a vice versa process,” says Mahesh. “Maybe a writer can do this solo, but it wouldn’t have been as funny or gotten better. In the case of Madhura Manohara Moham, I felt everything worked out because both of us decided to sit down and brainstorm ideas.” \n\nApproaching director Stephy Zaviour—a seasoned costume designer making her debut behind the camera—was not, Jai says, a planned move. To make a long story short, it was an organic process which happened when Jai and Mahesh discussed casting Rajisha Vijayan in an integral role. \n“The director’s gender is irrelevant here,” says Jai. “We were particular from the outset that we had to approach this material in a way that doesn’t probe the reasons for a particular’s toxic behaviour. It was not important. Certain characters don’t require explanations.\n\nThat’s the old filmmaking approach; it wouldn’t work today. We also didn’t want to resort to preaching. It wouldn’t work if we only thought of pleasing that one per cent that, on social media, talks about what is correct or not. Ultimately, the idea is to entertain—and show this is how some people are. Of course, we do express our politics in a nuanced manner, but creating a revolution wasn’t our end goal. When people laugh at these characters, we know we have achieved what we intended. I don’t believe cinema is a medium to advise anyone.”\n\nWriters Jai Vishnu and Mahesh Gopal on collaborating for Madhura Manohara Moham, which marked the directorial debut of costume designer Stephy Zaviour, and featuring Sharafudheen, Rajisha Vijayan, Bindu Panicker, and Saiju Kurup in major roles ",

      "image": "",
      "description": "Fresh from the success of The Kerala Crime Files, Aju Varghese lays bare his insecurities and shift in priorities and perspectives In cinema, stereotyping is a curse that actors have to deal with. Comedy actors, despite doing the toughest job of making people laugh, are mostly the victims of this phenomenon. But history has often proven that an actor who does comedy can handle characters of any shade with relative ease. Aju Varghese, who was confined to humour-oriented roles for a major part of his career, grabbed eyeballs every time he got a chance to display his potential beyond comedy.\n\nZachariayude Garbhinikal, Su.. Su... Sudhi Vathmeekam, Rakshadhikari Baiju Oppu, and the more recent blockbuster, 2018 are some films that showcased the other side of Aju. Thirteen years after his debut, Aju is today the lead actor of Disney+ Hotstar’s maiden Malayalam web series, Kerala Crime Files. It has been quite an eventful journey, but Aju is not one to gloat over it. He is still concerned about his insecurities and the challenges that lie ahead. \n\nHere are excerpts from a candid conversation with the unassuming actor:\n\nFrom Kuttu of Malarvadi Arts Club to SI Manoj of Kerala Crime Files, how much have your priorities changed in cinema?\nA lot. Initially, I wasn’t concerned about being typecast. My principle was to do whatever that comes my way. But during the pandemic, there was plenty of time for introspection, and I realised I should be doing something meaningful. I decided to be choosy, and I’m jobless most days now (laughs).\n\nBut are you truly happy with that decision?\nYes, but I’m also aware that I can’t always be selective. There are a few compromises that I’ve to make peace with, like if it’s a friend’s project or if I’m financially constrained. An actor like me doesn’t always have the choice to wait for extraordinary plots or characters. I might even take up a film with an unexciting storyline if I’m playing an interesting character. But if it doesn’t have any major contribution to the plot, I bluntly reject it now.\n\nYou’ve often admitted to requesting roles from senior filmmakers. Doesn’t that affect your policy of being choosy?\nThere’s always a temptation when it comes to working with superstars or senior filmmakers. These are people I idolised growing up. Forget working together, just seeing them from close quarters excites me. So I get tempted to ask for roles. It might not always be a prominent part, but I try and request a good dialogue or a memorable moment. I still ask for roles with anyone with whom I genuinely want to collaborate.\n\nDo you shy away from doing lead roles?\nWhen I’m offered a role, I first think about whether I want to see myself in that part. I’ll take it up only if I feel comfortable imagining myself in those shoes. I’m also more at ease doing character roles. That’s where I feel I’m more original and enjoying the process. I also know my limitations. I’m well aware that I don’t fit in the expectations of a typical hero. Moreover, I don’t want a producer to risk crores of money on an actor without market value.\n\nIs that why you agreed to do a web series, where conventional market value doesn’t dictate terms?\nThat’s one factor. But I also had a lot of trust in the show’s director Ahammed (Khabeer) and producer Rahul (Riji Nair). Ahammed has proven his mettle with two hit films (June and Madhuram), and Rahul is an award-winning filmmaker. There was also Padmarajan sir’s son, Ananthapadmanabhan, as part of Hotstar’s team. He was one of the key factors that lead me to this project. So, I had confidence in the team and knew that they’ll land this project safely. But it was much closer to release, did I realise the magnitude of its reach.\n\nHow do you feel when people rate this as your career best?\nI feel a lot of responsibility is over. But I’m also aware that the span of this adulation is only till my next bad performance.\n\nWhat was the initial character brief you got for SI Manoj?\nI usually don’t ask for in-depth narrations if I trust the maker. But Ahammed gave me a clear picture of the story and explained how it’s based on a true incident. My character is also loosely based on a real-life policeman, Vijay Shankar. He’s not the super cop that we usually celebrate in the cinema. He’s more like the cops in Action Hero Biju and Antakshari—real and relatable. We haven’t retained his traits as such but borrowed some basic details like his soft-spoken nature. We wanted Manoj to be a gentle guy like him without the persona of a typical cop. Perhaps that’s why I got cast for the role. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have chosen someone who predominantly did humour roles.\n\nYou’ve earlier played police roles in Helen and Minnal Murali, and they both were diametrically opposite to Manoj...\nTrue, they both were fraud characters (laughs). This is the first time I’m playing an honest cop, and I just followed Ahammed’s instructions. He had already done a lot of homework for my character and that was convincing enough for me. If I put in more effort, it would end up as a mess. I know I can’t produce the same output as someone who has worked on a character for months. When a maker is clear in his vision and knows what he wants, then it’s better to go by his instincts. \n\nInitially, there’s a smirk in Manoj’s face every time he lands a clue. But it fades as the investigation progresses without yielding any results...\nIt was completely Ahammed’s input. Though I wasn’t keen on having that smirk, he insisted on having it. As I said, it’s his vision, and there’s a reason why he was particular about it. Now that you’ve noticed and asked me this, I realise his interpretation of the character was spot-on.\n\nHow was the dynamics with Lal, who plays a contrasting character to yours?\nLal sir has been a constant presence every time I attempted something new in my career. The first film in which I played a non-comical role was  Zachariayude  Garbhinikal, which had Lal sir as the lead. He was also there in Helen, where I did a negative role. I remember after my first take in Helen, I didn’t look at director Mathukutty; my eyes automatically turned towards Lal sir for his approval, and he asked me to go for one more. Here’s someone who has directed and acted with some of the biggest legends of our times. Despite all that, he always gives me space to express my concerns. Working with him is a huge confidence booster.\n\nYou’ve often spoken about your lack of confidence...\nIt’s one of the major problems I face in my career. That’s why I rely completely on the directors. I believe my skills are limited to the duration between ‘action’ and ‘cut’. Before and after that, I’m heavily dependent on others. I recently spoke with an acting coach about my lack of confidence. He said only trained actors are not bothered about this issue. All others experience it—doesn’t matter if it’s your 50th or 100th film. I try hard to hide it, but deep inside, I’m aware that it still persists.\n\nBut what do you think is the reason for your confidence getting affected?\nMy ultimate dream is to become a character actor, and I know I still have a long way to go. But the sheer thought of what our predecessors have achieved and their range of skills kills my confidence. The benchmark they’ve set is huge; so I don’t strive to reach there, but I want to be an actor who filmmakers can trust with any kind of role. It makes me feel low when I realise I haven’t been able to come close to that.\n\nIs that why you always seek validation?\nExactly. I’m surrounded by some of the harshest critics you’ll ever come across, which includes my manager, admin and friends like Dhyan, Midhun Manuel and Bhagath. They’re very blunt with their opinions, and I think I need that to understand my limitations. We’re catering to a highly critical audience who’re accustomed to watching legendary performers. So, they’ll spot the bad apples easily. Being in the company of these ruthless critics will only help me improve my craft. It also makes me immune to the regular backlash from real critics and reviewers (laughs).\n\nWith increasing scrutiny fuelled by debates on political correctness, do you think the quality of humour has waned?\nI think humour evolves with time. The comedy I grew up watching was not the one in the 2000s, and it’s not the same today. There is a shift happening because of the kids’ exposure and the western influence. Regarding political correctness, I concur with what Ranjan Pramod sir said recently. Commercial cinema is not completely real. There are a few ingredients added to make it engaging and entertaining. In most commercial films, there’s a good guy and bad guy. A bad guy becomes one only when he does bad things. We can’t show both of them to be politically correct, but the key is not to propagate his evil deeds as acceptable and misguide the audience. Films should have politically incorrect characters and their actions can be glorified, but only from their perspective. The film shouldn’t glorify it. There’s a thin line that shouldn’t be crossed, but that line can’t be rigid. It’s up to the creator to decide how far they can push it. As an actor, I’m fine with delivering problematic lines if mine is a grey-shaded role and the line is needed to enhance the characterisation. But still, if it’s very abusive and doesn’t contribute anything to the character, I request it to be avoided or suggest better alternatives.\n\nDo you plan to be active in production, particularly when industry insiders feel Malayalam cinema is in a period of crisis?\nI’m not planning to be a full-time producer, but I’ll take up a project if things fall in place. Along with Dhyan and Visakh (Subramaniam), I am producing Dhyan’s next directorial. We’re thinking of having Nivin as the lead, but it hasn’t been finalised yet.\n\nAlso, I don’t feel this is an uncertain period in Malayalam cinema. In my 13 years of being in the industry, I haven’t seen a more beautiful phase in terms of the number of blockbusters releasing back to back. Malikappuram, Romancham and 2018 released within a gap of six months, and one among them is an industry hit. I think Romancham is the most profitable Malayalam film ever, if you consider the investment-returns ratio. So, when people say its a period of crisis, I think we’re being a bit harsh.\n\nAnd finally, how do you plan to take your career forward?\nI might sound regressive, but the fact is, I don’t plan anything beyond a month, especially post pandemic. I mostly take the advance only if the project begins in the next 2-3 months. I don’t like having any financial commitments beyond that. ",

      "description": "... says couple Harirprriya and Vasishta Simha, who share screen space for the first time in Ashok Teja’s directorial, Yadha Yadha Hi, which sees its release this week Hariprriya and Vasishta Simha, who are now a couple, claim to be good critics of each other. Their friendship started because of mutual admiration for each other’s work. The duo share screen space for the first time in Ashok Teja’s directorial, Yadha Yadha Hi. Hariprriya reveals that she took up the film solely because of the script, while Vasishta states that he picked up the film because of his love for his wife, Hariprriya.\n\nWhile both actors compliment each other, Vasishta, who is an actor and a good singer, teaches singing to Hariprriya, and in turn, he learns dance from her. In a conversation with CE, they share their experience working together in Yadha Yadha Hi, their future projects, and their way forward.\n\nDespite giving importance to stories and her role, Hariprriya reveals that she initially had reservations about taking up the project, “I was hesitant because some scenes demanded intimacy, and if Vasishta hadn’t agreed, I might have declined the project. I thank him for taking on the project,” she says.\n\n\nVasishta Simha and Hariprriya\n\n\nVasishta, on the other hand, believes that when an artiste of Hariprriya’s calibre is involved, she needs full support to pull it off with ease. “We took a conscious decision to do the film and capturing romance when in love was fun,” he says.\n\nYadha Yadha Hi is a remake of the Telugu film Yavaru, which itself was a remake of the Bollywood film Badla which is inspired by a Spanish flick Contratiempo. Vasishta mentions that he doesn’t believe in scene-by-scene remakes. He believes that an inspired film should have a connection and blend with the local culture and nativity, especially in terms of characters and treatment. “Since I had previously worked with the director in a Telugu hit film called Odela Railway Station,I had the opportunity to contribute to the film right from the script, says the actor, as he explains that the remakes are fading with the trend of pan-India films. “The vitality and importance of a script will be known when it is rewritten and adapted well to the local language and culture.”\n\nRegarding their roles in Yadha Yadha Hi, Hariprriya mentions that every character in the film feels real, and each actor has something significant to offer. Vasishta adds that the lead characters have negative aspects, creating a blend of human emotions and joyous characteristics.\n\nThe two discuss their working experience in Yadha Yadha Hi, and Hariprriya states that they maintained a professional approach on set and behaved like colleagues, even though they were in a romantic relationship. Vasishta adds that their experience as actors, with over 40 movies under their belt, speaks for itself.\n\nHariprriya who shares screen space with Diganth, says she  never imagined him playing a cop, and he pulled off the role very well. Vasishta notes that Diganth even though donning a Khaki, brings out his mischievous side and humour, blending it well with the character.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of working together again in future projects, both actors express their openness to collaborate if the script demands it. “I am particular to work in subjects that give equal prominence to both of us as actors and offer something fresh and unique,” says Hariprriya, who is currently on a break, and is searching for an offer she cannot reject. “We have received many scripts after our engagement and are considering them,” adds Vasishta.\n\nWhen asked about their favourite roles, Hariprriya mentions that she fell in love with Vasishta’s role in Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu and that has been one of his best performances to date. Vasishta says most of Hariprriya’s films are character-oriented and she delivers them with ease, and he admires her on screen. “I am not a fan of women being typecasted, and that’s a personal commitment I’ve made. I particularly enjoyed her performance in Ricky, where she portrayed dual shades.”\n\nComing back to Yadha Yadha Hi, the subject has been tested and proven due to its potential. “ The film aims to highlight the thrilling experience and create emotionally blended sequences that make it relatable. It is engaging, beautiful, and technically rich. Our goal is to provide engagement and entertainment through the movie. We watched the film a few days ago, and it has turned out well,” sums up Vasishta. ",

This prompted Shrivathsa Rao to consider me for the lead role,” expresses Sumit.\n\nGadayuddha, which will be released in multiples languages delves into the intriguing subjects of black magic and witchcraft, prevalent in Bengal and Kerala, with extensive research by the director. Shrivathsa Rao devoted two years for preparation, aiming to deliver both information and entertainment. The narrative primarily focuses on Banamati, a specific black magic practiced in Maharashtra.\n\n“Though Gadayuddha approaches the subject scientifically, it also maintains a commercial appeal. The filming of the climactic scene alone took 14 days, with a production cost of 1 crore,” shares Sumit, emphasising the dedication put into the project.\n\nNitin Shirgurkar serves as the film’s producer, while Dhanya Patil plays the heroine. Noted actors such as Sarath Lohitaswa, Ayyappa Sharma, Sadhu Kokila, and Sparsha Rekha play prominent characters in the film, and Vice King is the composer. ",

Filmmakers have increasingly embraced technology in their craft, and Road King, starring newcomer Mateen Hussain, is claimed to be the first film to be directed through video conferencing. The Kannada film marks the debut of Hollywood director Randy Kent and is based on an actual incident that occurred in Kolar a few years ago.\n\nMateen Hussain, who is making his acting debut, also takes on the role of producer for this film, scheduled for release on June 23rd. In an interaction with CE, Mateen explains the use of new technology in the making of the film revealing that he approached several directors in the industry, but most of them declined due to budget constraints. “Since I grew up in the USA, I have known Randy Kent (Life of Lemon, and Perfect House) for a long time. I requested him to direct the project. Initially, he hesitated due to the language barrier, but eventually agreed to direct the film.”\n\nDue to visa issues, Randy Kent was unable to travel to Bengaluru, which led to the decision to direct the film through Skype. “Despite two attempts, he couldn’t obtain a visa for various reasons, and he couldn’t come to Bangalore. Finally, he directed the film from the USA through Skype, making it the first film directed via video conferencing,” reveals Mateen.\n\nRoad King revolved around a rare disorder called Obsessive Ex syndrome and was filmed in Bangalore and other locations. In addition to Mateen, the film features Rukshar Dhillon, Leela Mohan, Harish Sejekan, Nayana Shetty, and others in prominent roles. Arif Lalani serves as the cinematographer, while sound designer Scott Wolf, known for his work in various Hollywood films, has collaborated with Road King. Shri Crazy Minds handles the editing. ",

      "description": "Hemanth clarifies that their decision to make a two-part series was not driven by the hype surrounding popular franchises released in two parts. Director Hemanth M Rao explains the rationale behind presenting the ‘Side A’ and ‘Side B’ of this intense love drama. The film, starring Rakshit Shetty in two shades, will have its release dates announced on June 15\n\nTeam Sapta Sagaradaache Ello made a special announcement on Tuesday to celebrate actor-producer Rakshit Shetty’s birthday.\n\nInterestingly, the makers are presenting this intense love drama as a two-part series, and the release dates will be revealed on June 15. Unlike other projects that label their parts as Part 1 and Part 2, this team has chosen to refer to them as Side A and Side B, and it has caught all our attention. Hemanth M Rao, in his interaction with CE, explains the decision to make it a two-part series. He says, “In the teaser, we have featured a cassette, which plays a crucial role and is closely tied to the story. That’s one of the reasons we decided to call them ‘Side A’ and ‘Side B’.”  \n\nThe film is bankrolled under Rakshit Shetty’s home banner, Paramvah Studios,  also stars Rukmini Vasanth and Chaithra Achar as the female leads and has music composed by Charan Raj, and cinematography is handled by Advaitha Gurumurthy.  \n\nWhile two-part series has become a trend, mostly in the action and commercial entertainment genres, Hemanth Rao explains the rationale behind presenting the intense love drama in two parts. He says, “Any story can be divided into multiple parts, just like a web series with various episodes that come together to form a complete story. Similarly, our story has a sense of epicness. Besides being an intense love drama, it incorporates various elements and life lessons. There is also action. Simply put, Sapta Sagaradaache Ello is like a poem, and the poetic journey can be fully enjoyed when presented in two parts. Of course, there will inevitably be comparisons between having an action-oriented film and a love story in two parts, but that will be best explained when the audience watches it in theatres.”\n\nHemanth clarifies that their decision to make a two-part series was not driven by the hype surrounding popular franchises released in two parts. It was a conscious choice to stay true to the story. He says, “As a director, I treat each of my films as if it were my first and last. This has been my guiding principle. Godi Banna Sadharna Mykattu had its innocence, and the same can be said with my second outing, Kavaludaari. Similarly, this film carries that innocence. I had written this story long before Godhi Banna..., and I always wanted it to be my debut film. I waited for years to tell this story. In fact, I discussed it with Rakshit Shetty when I gave him the script reading. However, we chose not to announce it back then because there was already a lot of hype around films like KGF and Baahubali being released in two parts, and we didn’t want it to seem like we were following a trend. We have actually completed shooting both parts of the series and are now announcing the release dates.”\n\nUnlike other projects that have a significant gap between the release of Part 1 and Part 2, this team has decided to release Side A and Side B in quick succession. Hemanth says, “The audience can enjoy the second part while the memories of Part 1 are still fresh in their minds.” He also reveals that Side A will have a runtime of two hours and fifteen minutes, while Side B will be two hours and twenty minutes. The director had previously announced that Sapta Sagaradaache Ello would be released in July. Now, it remains to see on which dates they plan to hit the theatres. ",

      "description": "... says veteran music composer and director V Manohar as he talks about his upcoming film Darbar,\nslated to release this week When V Manohar entered the film industry almost three decades ago, it was with aspirations of becoming a director. However, his lyric-writing talent caught the attention of filmmaker Upendra, who turned him into a music composer. After working in over 230 films as a composer, he also turned director with O Mallige(1997), which achieved great success. He followed it up with Indradhanush(2000), which fell short of expectations. Now, 23 years later, Manohar returns to helm his third project, Darbar, which will also have music composed by him.\n\nIn an interview with CE, Manohar, who is also known for his appearance on the popular reality show Maja Talkies, shares the reasons behind the long gap in his directorial career and discusses the disparities between shooting on a reel and working in the digital realm.\n\n“After Indradhanush, I struggled to find the right producers. Those who expressed interest either abandoned the projects midway or caused delays, putting me in a difficult situation. Fortunately, my involvement in music composition kept me occupied, and my work in the small screen industry helped me stay afloat,” says Manohar, expressing his bewilderment at the failure of production houses to recognise his directorial capabilities.\n\nHaving directed O Mallige and Indradhanush using traditional methods, transitioning to direct Darbar proved to be a novel experience for the filmmaker. “Shooting on reels had its limitations, leaving little room for mistakes. We had to conduct extensive rehearsals before capturing the final shots. With digital technology, we can afford to say ‘One more, one more,’ but rehearsals remain essential even today. The filmmaking process has undergone significant advancements. Regardless of our approach, the key to competing lies in presenting compelling stories. I believe that we should rely on our creative instincts rather than extravagant budgets,” explains the veteran.\n\nDarbar is presented as a political satire, highlighting the corrupt system with a touch of humour. Manohar firmly believes that contemporary audiences, immersed in the fast-paced world of the 2020s, prefer light-hearted subjects and a swift narrative pace. This understanding influenced his direction of Darbar.\nSathish, who plays the lead, has also written the dialogues and screenplay. The film features a cast comprising Jahnvi, Sadhu Kokila, veteran actor Ashok, Lakshmi Devamma, Naveen Padil, Santhu, Karthik, Thriveni, and others. ",

When it was originally staged in ’88, the Kannada play Nagamandala was an important milestone in Kannada theatre. Penned by Jnanapith awardee Girish Karnad and drawing upon folklore and myths, the play explores themes such as gender dynamics and is layered with symbolism and metaphors. Often considered one of the most important plays, Nagamandala is being staged once again this weekend at Prestige Srihari Khoday Centre for Performing Arts. This happens to be on Karnad’s death anniversary, however, the play will be a celebration of the late thespian’s life and 85th birth anniversary which was on May 19.\n\n\nActors rehearsing for Nagamandala\n\n\nDirected by the artistic director of the Bangalore Theatre Company, Arjun Kabbina, the Kannada play will have English subtitles being projected. While Nagamandala has been staged numerous times in various languages from the late ’80s, Kabbina says that the upcoming production will be unlike any other. “Past productions have interpreted the characters in ways other than Karnad intended them to be,” says the veteran dramatist.\n\nSet in rural Karnataka, the play revolves around a young woman trapped in an unhappy marriage, who seeks solace in a shape-shifting serpent. It looks into the struggles women face in oppressive relationships and how they choose to escape them. Kabbina adds, “With the play, Karnad wrote three different climaxes, from the perspective of the three main characters. But many previous stage adaptations do not stay faithful to that writing.”\n\nKabbina was unaware of the play until he came across it during his time at Rangayana, nearly a decade ago. “I had seen the movie, of course, but I didn’t know that it was adapted from a play. I decided to make a team work on it and thankfully, Karnad sir also visited Rangayana for a seminar, and we [the students] were supposed to have a conversation with him. During that seminar, I asked a lot of questions about the way he had written the play and he answered them calmly,” he shares. Due to various factors, it took more than a decade for Kabbina to realise his dream.\n\n“I couldn’t imagine that I would one-day direct Nagamandala, as I’ve always been an actor more than a director. Initially, I struggled with it but my team helped me execute it. I also spoke to former collaborators of Karnad, which helped tremendously,” he concludes.(Nagamandala will be staged on June 9, 10, and 11 at 7 pm, Prestige Srihari Khoday Centre for Performing Arts, Kanakapura Road. Tickets priced Rs 500 onwards on bookmyshow.com) ",

On the fourth death anniversary of Jnanpith awardee Girish Karnad, director KM Chaitanya, veteran actors Arundathi Nag, Padmavati Rao, and author and playwright Vivek Shanbhag fondly reminisce about the thespian\n\nActor and thespian Arundathi Nag’s earliest memory of Girish Karnad are from the sets of Ondanondu Kaladalli – written by Karnad and starring her future husband Shankar Nag in the lead. “A young, denim-clad director with a cigarette in his mouth and completely in control of the situation. Cinema is such a fragmented art that your team needs to be completely with you. He had a good team, of course, but there was something about his style that – despite working in some of the most difficult conditions – helped create magic on screen,” says Nag.\n\n\nThe many faces of Girish Karnad\n\n\nOn the fourth anniversary of Karnad’s passing, Nag says she misses the fun-loving senior whom she always looked up to.  “It’s a loss for theatre, but it’s a greater loss for India.  Here was a man who openly aligned himself with anti-establishment movements, while few dared to stand up. Hence, in Girish, we lost a role model,” Nag shares. \n\nKarnad left an indelible mark on the cultural landscape. From introducing talented actors like Shankar Nag and Vishnuvardhan, writing and directing thoughtful plays like Tughlaq and Nagamandala to delivering memorable performances on stage and screen, the Jnanpith awardee showcased his artistic brilliance in many ways. \n\nAmong the actors that benefitted from his guidance is Padmavati Rao, sister of Nag. “I was 15 when I first met him. I had bunked my classes to go find him at Bombay labs, to ask if I could work on Ondanondu Kaladalli. When I met him, I was in awe. He was a bundle of affection and warmth, always available to guide you,” Rao says. Since then, Rao worked with Karnad for over 40 years.\n\nThe last time she met him was a week before his passing. She remembers the meeting acutely, “He had given me Crossing to Talikota to translate. I gave the final draft to him a week before his passing. When he started to read, I was leaving, and he asked me to sit with him. We talked for a while. I feel we both knew that it would be the last time we would meet,” she says. \n\nDirector KM Chaitanya, a long-time collaborator of Karnad, says, “He was a mathematical genius in writing. When we were shooting for Kanooru Heggadithi, I was his associate director. He would keep improvising, and I would ask him not to because it would disrupt filming schedules. But he assured me that it wouldn’t and asked me to rewrite dialogues in the scene he had improvised in a particular order. When I did that, the scene had completely changed, but the duration had remained the same.”\n\n“There was a step change when Karnad burst into the Kannada theatre scene. The sensibilities and structure he brought into playwriting were unlike any other.  His play Tughlaq, for instance,  still remains relevant today, despite numerous productions. That goes to show the power of the play. He was able to  create a metaphor about power and loneliness of a human being, which to the world, at that point looked like the story of a madman.”  — Vivek Shanbhag, author and playwright ",

      "description": "Writer-actor-director unveils first look motion poster as he discusses Toby, which is billed as a big production venture, set for August 25 release. Raj B Shetty has carved a niche for himself in the Kannada industry with his unique storytelling and distinctive filmmaking style. After the success of Ondu Motteya Kathe, the actor-director followed it up with Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana.\n\nWhile he has completed shooting for Swati Mutthina Male Haniye, which is currently in the post-production stage, he has also been simultaneously working on another project, titled Toby, which is now gearing up for release. \n\n“The moment we have all been eagerly waiting for has arrived, the ‘Beast’, Make way for Maari! The beast that brought out the best in us! Presenting to you, #TOBY,” wrote Raj as he announced the release date to be August 25. While Raj has written the story, TK Dayanand has written the screenplay. Raj also headlines the project and wielded the megaphone along with  Basil Alchalakkal, who makes his directorial debut with this film.\n\nThe first look of Toby featured a nose-ring sporting an angry goat. Explaining the underlying theme of the story, Raj, who plays the titular role says, “The tagline ‘Mari Mari Marige Daari’ holds great significance to our film. The poster of Toby represents a goat, which symbolises an animal traditionally offered as a sacrifice to the Gods.\n\nWhat if the goat itself becomes a Maari? That’s what the attached nose ring signifies. To put it simply, you can push a man to his limits, but when pushed too far, assuming he is meek or weak like a sheep, he will pounce back, and with a strong reaction. The concept of Maari is not limited to any gender; it represents energy that is incredibly powerful.” When asked why he always plays characters based on reality, Raj says, “At one point, we become the judgment we project onto others. This is a personal experience that I went through. The theme was there, and the experience synced.” \n\nDelving into the creative process, Raj says, “I took the issue of my baldness and made Ondu Motteya Kathe. My second film was based on the experience of how the success of my debut changed the power dynamics, which led to making Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana. When I wrote Swati Mutthina Male Haniye, it was inspired by the bond I share with my mother. A writer cannot pen thoughts without drawing from their own experiences. Any revolution is a writer’s inspiration, and that’s how Toby came about.” \n\nInterestingly, Toby distributed by KVN Productions, is a big-budget production, backed by Lighter Buddha Films in association with Agastya Films and Coffee Gang Studios. \n\nWhile Mithun Mukundan is in charge of the music direction, Praveen Shriyan handles cinematography and editing. The film also stars Samyukta Horanad, Chaitra Achar, Gopalakrishnan Deshpande, and Deepak Raj Shetty. ",

Yogaraj Bhat’s upcoming sports drama, Garadi, is generating the right buzz, especially with the pivotal roles of Darshan and BC Patil.\n\nThe latter is also producing the film under the Sowmya Films And Kourava Production House. Starring Soorya and Sonal Monteiro in the lead, the makers recently unveiled the first-look poster of Soorya in a wrestler’s avatar. They have now released the first single, which marks the first-ever special song for actor Nishvika Naidu.\n\nTitled Hodirele Halagi, the song is written by Yogaraj Bhat in the North Karnataka dialect and composed by V Harikrishna. Since its release, the song has quickly become a hit among listeners. Sharing her excitement, Nishvika states that it provided her an opportunity to showcase her dancing talent. “I have never done a full-fledged dance number with the spotlight solely on me, and Hodirele Halagi presented me with that opportunity,” says Nishvika, who has a background in classical dance and is trained in film and folk steps. Strongly believing that such songs are more about the movements rather than perfection, Nishvika says, “Harsha master had planned a set of compositions and I enjoyed dancing to the tunes, despite the challenges.” \n\nThe actor also opined that special numbers in Kannada films should provide more opportunities for local heroines, who are not only talented but also excel in dancing. This is her second guest appearance in a Yogaraj Bhat film after Gaalipata 2. Incidentally, Nishvika is also playing the lead in the director’s next, Karataka Dhamanaka, starring Shivarajkumar and Prabhudheva. “I know a director like Yogaraj Bhat would take a lot of care in casting an actor, and I’m glad I got the opportunity.” \n\nWhile currently occupied with Karataka Dhamanaka, Nishvika is taking her time to choose her next project. “I believe the year holds promising for me, and I’m optimistic about exploring new characters and not returning to roles I have played so far. That is why I accepted the dance number in Garadi. It allowed me to showcase a side of me that viewers have not seen before,” says Nishvika, who emphasises the importance of versatility for actors. “We should not be confined to playing only the girl-next-door roles. While it is crucial to fully immerse oneself in a character, it is equally rewarding to embrace the glamorous side and shine on screen.” ",

      "description": "Director Vinu Balanja dives into new territory with his debut, Bera, as he reflects on his journey from serials, the challenges of Naathuram, and the power of unfinished stories\n  Vinu Balanja aspired to be an actor but fate led him to filmmaking. He is a well-known name in world of the small screen since 1998, and has earned recognition for directing TV serials like Preethi Illada Mele featuring Yash and Anant Nag, Neeharika, Love Lavike, and Janaki Raghava.\n\nVinu has collaborated with renowned personalities like TN Seetharam and P Seshadri, and the production house like Vajreshwari.\n\n“While there are numerous avenues for artists and directors to explore today, there is a notable difference between working in the small screen and films,” he says, expressing his enthusiasm on venturing into new horizons with Bera.\n\nNotably, Vinu would have made his debut in the film industry with Naathuram, starring Rishab Shetty if everything had gone as planned. However, although one schedule was completed, the project was abruptly halted for unknown reasons, and the subsequent pandemic further hindered its progress.\n\n“There are various reasons why a film may face obstacles, and Naathuram, which had a promising start, unfortunately, couldn’t proceed. It would have undoubtedly been a milestone in my career and a noteworthy film for the Kannada industry,” expresses Vinu, who still hopes to resume Naathuram and present it content to the audience. “Certain projects may remain incomplete, but their stories should not. I aspire to bring it to fruition someday,” he asserts.\n\nCurrently, Vinu Balanja is preparing for the release of Bera, scheduled for June 16, alongside the highly anticipated Pan India film Adipurush, starring Prabhas. Bera has garnered attention primarily due to its content. According to Vinu, who is also the story writer, Bera delves into a socio-political theme, portraying the growing communalisation of society, particularly in the coastal belt of Karnataka.\n\nThe film has generated buzz through its intriguing rushes and teasers and has drawn comparisons with films like The Kashmir Files (2022) and The Kerala Story (2023).\n\nHowever, the director emphasises that Bera, with its unique storyline, stands out as an unexplored concept in Kannada cinema. “Derived from the Tulu language, the title Bera translates to ‘Business,’ and the tagline ‘Merchant of Death’ adds significant meaning to the film,” explains the director, emphasising that Bera addresses the issue of communal violence driven by hidden agendas and focuses on targeted leadership.\n\n“’ Birth is a divine decision, and it is the responsibility of each individual to accept its outcomes’, is the underlying theme of Bera. It is absolutely unjustifiable for anyone to possess the authority to take another person’s life,” he says.\n\nBera, produced by Divakar Das, primarily unfolds in Kalladka, a town situated in the Bantwal taluk of Dakshina Kannada, known for its history of communal conflicts. With a clear vision of capturing the authentic essence of the location, the director incorporated the local Kalladka dialect, adding a touch of local flavour to the storytelling.\n\n“The film revolves around the Kalladka museum, where four antique pillars and  194 ancient coins managed by my friend, served as the inspiration for Bera,” reveals the director and adds that the film explores not only communalisation but also sheds light on religious terrorism through two main characters, Vishnu and Salim, portrayed by Rakesh Maiya and Yash Shetty.  \n\nThe film stars notable artists like Dattanna, Suman Talwar, Manjunath Hegde, Harshika Poonachcha, Ashwin Hassan, and Chitkala Biradar. Bera music is composed by Manikanth Kadri and the cinematography is handled by Rajashekhar.  ",

I had two film releases during the first and second waves of the pandemic. However, after these two films, I didn’t find the right scripts that I wanted to be a part of.\n\nThe discussions with the makers of Devara Aata Ballavararu have been ongoing since last year, and finally, we are ready to go on floors,” says Sindhu, whose role in the film has three different shades, and posed a unique challenge to her. “The director has come up with a unique plot a retro theme, based on a true incident that occurred in our country in 1975 which had a significant impact on the public.\n\nSecondly, my character has Tourette’s syndrome. The director showed me many videos, which gave me an idea as to what was expected of that role. I have been rehearsing for the past three months. On set, we will have seven cameras capturing the scenes. All of this is extremely exciting to me. It’s like preparing for a skit, where we prepare for the entire scene and then bring spontaneity to it,” she explains.\n\nThe makers are planning to start shooting on June 23 in Madikeri. The shooting, editing, DI, and background music will all take place in the same location. “We plan to complete the shoot in 12-16 days and finish post-production, sticking to our planned release date of July 23. I am thrilled to be a part of this roller-coaster ride, which is one of the reasons I chose this project,” she says.\n\nTalking about her script choices, Sindhu shares that she never wanted to be a typical heroine. “I want to be addressed as an actor and not just another heroine. I don’t want to be bubbly, deliver dialogues, and dance well just to gain a fan following. It is not my cup of tea. I truly want to play characters that I cannot be in real life. I had a strategy from the beginning of my career not to take up roles that don’t connect with me, just for the sake of money.\n\nI have been asked many times why I haven’t been seen in many films. The only reason is that I didn’t like any of the scripts presented to me recently. For example, after Love in Mandya, I was offered a series of films in the same genre, and they wanted me to play a village belle, which I refused. In every film, I want to be seen as a different person in a different character,” she signs off.\n\n...says Sindhu Loknath, while discussing her upcoming film Devara Aata Ballavararu, reveals why she chose to be part of a film that aims to set a Guinness record by completing shooting and releasing within a span of 30 days\n  ",

While they aim to begin shooting in August, they have also set the release date as Sankranti 2024.\n\nThough pan-Indian films have become a trend now, it is the first attempt for Prajwal, who has acted in over 35 films.\n\nWhen asked about his views on the pan-Indian popularity and his excitement to be part of a multilingual film, Prajwal shares, “Firstly, a universal theme defines a pan-India subject. This is a basic step for any multilingual project. Alternatively, we have to stay true to our region like Kantara, which was never planned as a pan-India film but gained global recognition. Jathara will be something similar. It is a film set in a village, and the story beautifully combines a love story, action, and a sports backdrop. The crux of the story is unique and all are carefully woven together by the director.” he says.\n\nPrajwal is no stranger to other regions, as his Kannada films are usually dubbed into other languages after release. However, why did this particular subject warrant a simultaneous release?\n\n“No one can stop good content from releasing in multiple languages if there is a demand for it. I was essentially looking for a good script and a passionate team that strives for something new, and I found that in director Uday and his subject. The thought process behind the story, written by Vasudev Reddy, has been developed well. The makers felt that this is a subject that can resonate with every audience, regardless of the language, and I embraced it after reading the script. We will be shooting in Kannada and Telugu and then dubbing and releasing it in other languages,” says Prajwal, who is equally excited to make his debut in Telugu and other languages.\n\nPrajwal’s only preparation for this film is to attend a short workshop to familiarise himself with Telugu. “I do speak Telugu, but I still wanted a workshop so that I can feel comfortable speaking the language on camera,” says Prajwal.\n\nWhile the casting process is ongoing, the film will also have a technical team from the local industry. Maasti is writing the dialogues in Kannada, Harish Komme is the editor. Bheems Ceciroleo, who composed music for Dhamaka, is handling the music, and cinematographer Sai Sriram will also be part of the project.\n\nOn the Kannada front, Prajwal is eagerly awaiting the release of Gana, followed by Mafia, for which he \nhas already completed shooting.\n\n“My other project with Mafia director, Lohit H is in the final phase of shooting, and we have just one week’s schedule left,” he concludes.

I am extremely grateful to our director Lijo for giving me the opportunity. I had some incredible conversations with the two of them. The entire crew comprised of highly accomplished people and it was fantastic to work with them. It is perhaps the greatest experience of my career so far,” shares Sait. \n\nDuring the shoot, the cast and crew had erratic schedules, and the filming happened in some difficult conditions. The group was isolated, and Sait feels that experience made him more comfortable with himself. “A lot of the places where we were shooting were in the wilderness. Usually, my wife accompanies me to all my shoots, but the conditions and my work timings were so hard that I couldn’t take her with me. Naturally, I got to spend a lot of time with myself,” he says. \n\nMalaikottai Vaaliban, which doesn’t have a release date yet, will be Sait’s debut in Malayalam cinema. He also acted in the recently released TV series on Netflix titled Scoop, which was helmed by the prominent filmmaker Hansal Mehta. In the show, Sait plays the character Sushant, an anchor at a news channel. \n\n“I did not face too many difficulties playing that character because I have vast experience as a TV presenter. So it’s not like I had to research a lot. I did not have too much time either. I was part of the IPL bubble in Mumbai then and had about a day in the middle to shoot for Scoop and I decided to do it. I even got to meet Hansal sir that day. He was very sweet and it all worked out well,” he says.\n\nFor Sait, there was a very distinct reason behind choosing to work on Malaikottai Vaaliban and Scoop, and that is American actor-comedian Bob Odenkirk’s (Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul fame) memoir Comedy Comedy Comedy Drama. “So, Bob Odenkirk had released his memoir just around when I was doing the IPL last year. I happened to get hold of that book, and around then, I was itching to do something different. It gave me great insight into the world of drama and the many kinds of possibilities it offers. I have always reinvented myself from working on the radio to making digital content and now to doing films,” shares Sait.\n\nDespite constantly reinventing, Sait, for the better part of his career, has been a lone wolf. But working with people like Pellissery and Mehta has given him a sense of ease. \n\n“I think after One Cut Two Cut released, I found myself getting tired of leading projects. When you mount a project, bring people together and take the responsibility on your shoulders, you sometimes lose out on the craft. Here in the case of Scoop or Malaikottai Vaaliban, it was more about submitting to another person’s vision. Both Pellissery and Mehta are among our country’s best creators. So, it kind of reset me as an artiste, and it has been a good one so far,” he concludes. ",

Actor Pramod and noted television producer Shruti Naidu, who made her silver screen debut with Premiere Padmini, are set to collaborate once again. The makers, who had previously announced their partnership, officially launched the project with a script pooja on Monday. The film, which is yet to be titled, will be a youthful entertainer and is scheduled to start filming in either July or August.\n\nSpeaking to CE, Pramod expressed his excitement about the upcoming project. “This project, produced by Shruti Naidu and written/directed by Ramesh Indira, is planned on a large scale. With Premiere Padmini, they established me as an actor. However, this story has intense content, and my character will deliver on all the commercial aspects. That’s why the director took a long time to pen the story. It is a film set in a college backdrop, revolving around friendship, love, and family. I am positive that it aligns with today’s trends,” says Pramod.\n\nHe further adds, “As of now, only the director, producer, and I have been finalised. Shooting locations have been decided, and the remaining cast and crew are in the process of joining the project.”\n\nMeanwhile, Pramod also revealed that Premiere Padmini 2 is also in the pipeline. “It is ready to go and will commence once we have completed the current project,” he says.\n\nCurrently, Pramod is occupied with the shooting of Bhuvanam Gaganam, with 10 days of shooting still pending. He will be shooting alongside Pruthvi Ambaar in the next 10 days. “The travel portions of the shoot require greenery and rain, and we will begin shooting shortly,” he says.\n\nThe actor is also eagerly awaiting the release of Salaar, a film starring Prabhas, in which he plays a pivotal role under the direction of Prashanth Neel. Additionally, Pramod is in talks for other projects, but his decisions will be based on his commitments with other ongoing projects. ",

      "description": "The actor, who is currently in the spotlight for her serial Amurthadhare in Kannada, is set to join Shivarajkumar-Narthan’s Bhairathi Ranagal. Noted South Indian actor Chaya Singh is thriving on both the small screen and the big screen. The actor, who is currently in the spotlight for her serial Amurthadhare in Kannada, is set to join Shivarajkumar-Narthan’s Bhairathi Ranagal. She was also part of their previous collaboration, Mufti.\n\nOn her return to Kannada cinema after a hiatus, Chaya shares that the decision to make Bhairathi Ranagal was made after Mufti (2017)., but it took time to come together. “I feel lucky to be doing good things in my career at this time. Working with a star like Shivarajkumar and director Narthan will be a different experience altogether. I’m eagerly waiting for the film to go on floors,” she says.\n\nRegarding her character in Bhairathi Ranagal, which is a prequel to Mufti, Chaya says, “In Mufti, we see a tiff between my Vedhavathi, and her brother Bhairathi Ranagal. Somewhere, the story left a lot of questions about his behaviour, and why he is like that. I guess with a prequel, it makes it interesting to see how both these characters shaped into what they were in Mufti.”\n\nWhen asked about her choices of roles today, Chaya says she has always been selective in her career. “From the beginning, I chose characters that blend into the story and connect with the audience. Sometimes things go wrong, but that’s part of it,” she says.\n\nWorking in two different mediums, Chaya reveals that the reason for her foray into the small screen in Kannada was definitely the script of Amruthadhare. “While being on the silver screen puts you in the limelight, being a household name is different. The serial provided that opportunity. Today, if I go out, people recognise me and say, “Hey, I see you every evening at 7 pm,” and I proudly respond, Yes,” says Chaya as she points out that the pandemic impacted the theatre-going habit. “If you want to reach the audience, you have to take different measures, including OTT and series.”\n\nApart from Bhairathi Ranagal, the actor is also part of Dinakar Thoogudeepa’s upcoming directorial Royal starring Virat, and she has completed shooting for it. She also has a Tamil film that is yet to go on floors. “I love working, and that’s what motivates me to get out of bed and go out. However, cinema is much easier as you have time to prepare. Television requires long hours of work and less time to prepare. You are challenged to keep your character in check, and it is amazing how fast your mind works when you are on the sets of a serial, which is not the case in films,” she says. ",

In the era of digital dominance, attracting audiences to the theatre is a formidable challenge. However, the creators of Namasthe Ghost have devised a fresh and effective strategy to overcome this obstacle.\n\nDirected by Bharat Nanda, who also portrays the lead role, this horror comedy is set to release on July 14. \n\nRecognising the power of positive word-of-mouth, the team screened the film to approximately 6,000 college students before its official release. By leveraging the students’ potential to generate buzz among their peers, the team aimed to expand the film’s audience base. To intensify anticipation, a distinctive trailer was unveiled, focusing solely on the genuine reactions of these college students.\n\nSpeaking about this innovative approach, Bharat explains, “There has been a significant decline in theatre attendance, especially for newcomers and small-budget movies. It is a growing concern in the current cinema industry. Despite the release of over 200-300 movies each year, only a handful gain recognition.\n\nThis makes it challenging for aspiring producers, creators, writers, and technicians to sustain their passion.” He further elaborates, “We approached more than 30 colleges and previewed the movie for free in their auditoriums, engaging with over 6,000 students. The response was tremendous. We not only rekindled the joy of communal viewing but also raised awareness about the industry’s current situation. The trailer showcases the love, responses, and encouragement we received from the students, lecturers, and principals we encountered on this journey.”\n\nNamasthe Ghost centres around the perils of wearing earphones in public and traffic zones, and blends this social issue with elements of horror. The protagonist, Shiva, is haunted by a recurring dream every day. In his quest to unravel the mystery behind the dream, he embarks on a perilous journey involving a spirited game, leading to unexpected challenges. \n\nIn addition to Bharat Nanda, the cast of Namasthe Ghost includes Vidya Raj, Bala Rajawadi, Shivakumar Aradhya, Shivamogga Harish, and others. The film is produced by Ramesh Kumar, under Chirayu Creative Cinema. While Yadunandan composed the music, Vinay Kumar edited the film. ",

      "description": "The veteran actor talks about his 500th film, coming from a theatre background, playing several roles, and his lifetime commitment with the silver screen. Age does not define Vijanath Biradar’s timeless talent. The 70-year-old veteran exudes the energy and enthusiasm of a fresher eager to showcase his skills. Known for his character roles, Biradar is now excited to take on the lead role in the film 90 Bidi Manig Nadi. The senior actor, who personally took part in promotional activities, reflects on his theater days, his poster-pasting phase, and engaging with people. “At 70, most people look for an end, but as an actor, it feels like a new beginning,” states Biradar, emphasising the importance of hard work, discipline, respect, and punctuality.\n\nDirected by Nagaraj Arehole and Umesh Badaradinni, 90 Bidi Manig Nadi features Biradar as an agarbatti seller and aims to shed light on the impact of alcoholism and its consequences on a family. “The film carries a powerful message about the value of being human and the responsibilities we have towards ourselves and others,” says the actor as he explains the film’s theme. He also recalls a challenging dance sequence that he believes he has pulled it off. \n\nBiradar reminisces about his early career, starting with a blink-and-miss role in the film Bara along with Anant Nag. However, it was in 1985, with the film Shankanaada, that he embarked on his full-time journey as an artist. With over 500 films to his credit, Biradar acknowledges his roots in theater and the versatility he has displayed across various characters. While many of his roles featured him as a drunk person, Biradar credits the directors for recognising his ability to do justice to such roles, which contributed to his popularity.\n\nDespite the accolades and support from the audience and the film industry, Biradar remains humble and eager to explore new territories. “Having been part of 500 film, I still feel there’s more to do. I aspire to portray a variety of roles that require experimentation,” says the actor, who believes ‘Cinema’ is like a guru, and he approaches it as a devoted student. “I feel time will offer the best opportunities on the silver screen.”\n\nDarshan is a very respectful individual when it comes to taking care of senior actors: Biradar\nKaatera, a film featuring Challenging Star Darshan, includes Biradar in a pivotal role. Recently, the makers unveiled a character poster featuring the senior actor recnetly. While Biradar has chosen to remain tight-lipped about the specifics of his role, he expresses his delight in collaborating with Darshan in the Tharun Sudhir Kishore directorial. Biradar shares, “I had the opportunity to work with Darshan’s father, Thoogudeepa Srinivas, and now it gives me immense pleasure to work with his son. I must mention that Darshan is a respectful individual when it comes to taking care of senior actors. On set, he ensures my well-being, makes me feel comfortable, and even enjoys a cup of tea with me.” The actor reveals that there are still a few portions of his role left to be filmed and that he promises to share more details as the release date draws nearer.

Rakshit Shetty, who is eagerly anticipating the release of Sapta Sagaradaache Ello, is also busy with his much-awaited directorial project, Richard Anthony made under Hombale Films. He plans to fully focus on his next project after SSE hits the screens.\n\nMeanwhile, the actor-director invites audiences into his film through -- Naa Kandante, a series of interactive videos that delve into the ancient Puranas, ithasas, and the revered deity, Lord Parashurama. In an intriguing letter on social media, Rakshit Shetty describes these videos as a philosophical representation of scientific studies from ancient times.\n\nIn an interaction with CE, Rakshit Shetty revealed his plan to release 10-part 3-4 minute videos that connect various dots, offering a deeper understanding of his upcoming film, Richard Anthony. He specifically mentions the Parashurama Kshetra series will not be a spoiler for Richard Anthony. “By familiarising oneself with these stories, viewers can gain a different perspective and enhance their comprehension of the film,” says Rakshit, who draws a parallel to his approach in Ulidavaru Kandante, albeit on a smaller scale. He also plans to follow it for his next project, Punyakoti too.\n\nNaa Kandante, featuring Rakshit Shetty himself, is created by Chandrajith Belliappa and shot by Darshan Kumar, with Nagarjun Sharma taking care of the dubbing. In the letter, Rakshit reminisces about his childhood, where his mother narrated a couple of stories, and the rest were discovered through conversations with people at the temple, fueling his imagination. Among all the temples, it was the Ananteshwara temple that fascinated him the most, as Lord Shiva held a special place in his heart.\n\nHowever, upon learning that the temple was dedicated to Parashurama in the form of a Linga Swaroopa, he was taken aback. This discovery sparked countless questions within him, leading to a never-ending quest for answers. It is this thirst for knowledge and a desire to connect the dots that drove Rakshit to become a storyteller.\n\nThe filmmaker emphasises the importance of incorporating these ancient philosophies into modern-day narratives, believing that they hold valuable lessons for human evolution. His ongoing research on philosophy and ancient times has naturally intertwined with the writing process of Richard Antony, creating a fascinating magnitude of storytelling possibilities. ",

      "description": "Unfazed by detractors, Anubhav Sinha plans to continue making and producing thought-provoking films such as Bheed and Afwaah\n  Circa 2019. Director Anubhav Sinha had wrapped up Article 15. Some of his closest friends, including filmmakers Sudhir Mishra, Avinash Das, Subhash Kapoor and Anurag Kashyap, had watched the film at his home.  Recalls Sinha: \n\n“We were chatting, when Subhash asked, ‘Anubhav bhai, kya pi rahe ho aajkal (what are you drinking these days)? \n\nTo which Kashyap responded, ‘Inse pooch, ab tak kya pi rahe the (ask him what he had been drinking up till now)?’”\n\nThe Dev.D director made the remark knowing the kind of films Sinha was capable of, versus the ones he made until Mulk (2018). Since then, all his films––Article 15, Thappad, Anek and the recently released, Bheed—have been relevant, hard-hitting and issue-driven.\n\nSinha has extended his directorial sensibilities to his role as a producer as well. Among the latest projects he bankrolled are Sudhir Mishra’s Afwaah on the issue of fake news, and the 2022 Hansal Mehta-directorial, Faraaz, inspired by the 2016 terror attacks in a café in Dhaka, Bangladesh.\n\nFor Sinha, it is a combination of two things that have to come together for him to produce a film. “One, what the story is trying to convey; two, people who are telling it,” he says. Although, more often than not, it is the first criterion that takes precedence, he backed both Afwaah and Faraaz since he wanted to work with Mishra and Mehta. “The choice of the story was theirs and therefore, their responsibility, but in my mind, the plot was secondary,” he adds.  \n\nHis filmography, however, was not always what it is today. With films such as Tum Bin, Dus, Cash and Ra.One under his belt, Sinha has been as mainstream as any Bollywood director can be.Self-admittedly, the director, who started out with thought-provoking television shows such as Shikast and Sea Hawks, got “drawn into the glitz, glamour and paraphernalia”. “At the time, the size of the film mattered to me more than what I wanted to say,” he recalls. The bittersweet reception of Ra.One brought everything down to dust. “Everyone talks highly of Ra.One today, but when it released in 2011, I was crushed. \n\nI didn’t know if I was a director at all,” he says. \n\nIt was the legal drama, Mulk––a story of a Muslim family in India, who fight to reclaim their honour after one of their members takes to terrorism––which was the turning point. \nIt was a response to what he saw around him. \n\n“I found my purpose as a director and the reason why I wanted to tell stories. Earlier it was a business and career,” he states.\n\nOver the years, Sinha has transformed into a filmmaker who is not afraid to speak his mind, making his work susceptible to objections from certain sections of society. Bheed, which talks about the lockdown-induced migrant crisis, is the latest victim, following the controversy over using Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s voiceover, and likening the exodus to Partition. He has, however, learnt to take it all in his stride. “I am now used to certain people attacking my IMDB ratings.\n\nDuring Article 15, some wanted to chop my head off and others wanted to cut my nose. Each time a trailer drops, someone has a problem. I think even if I borrow a script from Rohit (Shetty), they will still get angry with me,” says Sinha.\n\nAsk him what he’d like to make now, and he says, “An action film or a musical. My films, of \nlate, are missing music. I used to enjoy the process,” he says wistfully. There are currently three projects he is exploring. “Out of these, two are thrillers, but I am yet to begin writing,” he says. ",

      "description": "Sanya Malhotra talks about playing a small-town cop in Kathal, and working with Shah Rukh Khan in Jawan Seven years after she debuted with Aamir Khan’s Dangal, Sanya Malhotra is in the busiest phase of her career. After her recently released investigative satire, Kathal: \n\nA Jackfruit Mystery, she has three releases this year: Shah Rukh Khan’s action-thriller Jawan, Sam Bahadur with Vicky Kaushal, and Mrs, the Hindi remake of Malayalam film, The Great Indian Kitchen. “This is definitely the life I have manifested. It feels unreal. Last year, I was constantly working and shot five films back-to-back. Now I can sit back and enjoy with my audience,” says Malhotra.   \n\nInspired by true events, Kathal––which released on Netflix on May 19––brings a story from the heartlands of India, and is set in a fictional town called Moba. Malhotra plays Mahima Basor, a no-nonsense cop, who is put on the case of missing jackfruits from a politician’s garden. \n\n“I was blown away by the premise, and couldn’t believe it is based on true events,” she says, adding, “But Kathal offers more than just comedy. There is romance, mystery, drama and a social message. Its versatility and uniqueness attracted me.”\n\nThe film, directed by Yashowardhan Mishra, also stars some of Bollywood’s seasoned comedians, including Vijay Raaz, Rajpal Yadav, Raghubir Yadav and Gurpal Singh. Malhotra says working with them was as intimidating as it was inspiring. “When you have comic scenes and the actors around you are so fine, you don’t need to prep, you just have to listen to them and react. There were times when their performances would be so good that I would forget I have to keep a straight face,” the actor recalls.\n\nWhile she imbibed the comic skills from her co-stars rather quickly, getting the dialect right took a lot more work. “I have Neha Saraf (who plays Kunti Parihar) to thank. She helped me a lot. She’s from Bundelkhand and knows the dialect, so I was constantly conversing with her,” the 31-year-old says. \n\nAs for getting into the skin of her character, Malhotra stayed with a female police officer in Gwalior for a few days to understand how she managed her personal life, while dealing with serious cases at work. “We would sit in a corner in her office and watch her at work. There is a fear attached to the vardi (uniform), but we were also able to see her kinder side,” Malhotra says.\n\nRelatability is one thing she bears in mind while choosing scripts. Whether it is rom-coms (Badhaai Ho and Meenakshi Sundareshwar), dark comedies (Ludo and Pagglait), or social dramas (Love Hostel and Pataakha), the actor has consistently played strong-headed women, and Kathal is no exception.  “It is our responsibility to give women the right portrayal. Earlier, we used to be replaceable,” she says, adding, “Female-led comedies were unimaginable, but I am happy that finally writers are penning women characters who are pivotal for the script.”\n\nObviously, Malhotra had to look physically fit to play a cop, but that was a piece of cake for her. Says the actor: “Soon after Dangal, physical training became part of my life. I took up crossfit and boxing. Now I am prepared for any action role that comes my way.” No wonder she sounds pumped about her upcoming actioner, Jawan, in which she is expected to do high-intensity stunts. Without revealing much about her role, she says, “It is surreal to work with Shah Rukh Khan; it’s definitely a dream come true.”\n\nMalhotra says she’s happy to be part of films helmed by women directors like Meghna Gulzar and Arati Kadav. “The Great Indian Kitchen is made with a lot of love. Arati is so sensitive, intelligent and one of the best directors I have worked with. The film and character are close to my heart,” says the actor, for whom complacency is a strict no-no. “The day I stop learning, I will pack my bags and go back to Delhi,” she says.\n\nwith inputs from Shama Bhagat ",

      "description": "The assignment has helped him recognise new parts of his personality. Prodigious cricketer Shubman Gill, who has dubbed in Hindi and Punjabi for the recent release, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, talks about his love for the friendly neighbourhood superhero and how he coped with the challenges of voice-acting\n\nThere’s a precision to Shubman Gill’s batting. Even when he’s smashing sixes, there’s a pre-programmed quality to his hitting — almost like he’s doing exactly what’s necessary, nothing more, nothing less. A similar precision comes through as he speaks about dubbing in Hindi and Punjabi for the recently released film, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Like so many of his generation, Shubman fell in love with the Spider-Man character played by Tobey Maguire. “It’s the first superhero film I watched as a child. I think I saw its premiere on cable TV. I was already a fan of that poster… You know that iconic visual with those skyscrapers in Spider-Man’s large eyes?” he asks, his voice betraying a childlike excitement.\n\n\nShubman Gill\n\n\nGill didn’t have a Spider-Man costume though. “I don’t think I found something that fit…” he says. It didn’t stop him from imitating the superhero though. Most ordinary children would stop with trying to shoot cobwebs from the wrist, but Shubman remembers climbing on door frames and sometimes, even walls. His job as a voice artiste, of course, didn’t involve such physical challenges, but Gill points out it was hardly straightforward.\n\n“As a batsman, I’m clear in my objectives for every innings. Also, it helps that I have practised — and so, I feel no pressure on the cricket ground even if lakhs are watching. Here, nobody was watching me, and yet, it was difficult. Sometimes, I could recognise immediately after speaking a line that I didn’t quite sound right.” The big difference between cinema and cricket — as every cricketer will always point out — is that you get retakes in films. I ask if he wished sometimes that cricket had it too. Despite the apparent benefits, he isn’t tempted. “Cricket would be no fun. It’s exciting only because you don’t get a second chance.”\n\nGill, incidentally, is the first sportsperson from India to dub for a Hollywood film. “I was surprised when a friend brought this opportunity to me.” He had no qualms about accepting it though, as he felt it presented him with a new challenge, amplified further by it being an animated film. “The dialogues had to feel more animated than usual… I had to bring a childlike quality to my voice as well.”\n\nThe assignment has helped him recognise new parts of his personality. “I had to portray emotions I wasn’t exactly used to,” he says. Perhaps his advertisement experience came in handy? “A bit, yes,” he agrees. “But we rarely get melodramatic for an advertisement. The range of emotions you express for a film is incredible.” For a recent promotional video of the film, Gill posed like Spider-Man on top of a car, displaying showmanship we rarely see from him on a cricket ground. Perhaps he will act, some day? “Maybe, but I don’t think I’m skilled enough to be an actor, right now.”\n\nHis voice-acting is for an Indian Spider-Man called Pavitr Prabhakar, one of many Spider-Man characters in the film. Every time the multiverse idea has been explored in the Marvel universe, it has resulted in multiple versions of the same character realising their respective unique purpose, which usually leads to a reinforcement of their separate identities. For Gill, this realisation of self-worth happened when he represented the Under-16 side of Punjab and turned out to be the highest scorer of the tournament. “That’s when I knew I was on the right track. Prabhsimran, Prithvi, Arshdeep… All of us were in the same batch, and I realised that I had what it took to become a successful cricketer.”\n\nShubman and Spider-Man have one common quality, he points out: The ability to manage multiple responsibilities. “He’s a superhero, a school student, a boyfriend… At such a young age, he handles all these responsibilities. My life too demands that I manage several tasks at once, and I think I’m quite good at it.” Given that these polished responses to the media come from Gill a day after scoring a century to take his IPL team into the finals, it’s hard to disagree.\n  ",

The film will be helmed by debutant director Sudeep Kanwal. It is produced by Shlok Sharma and Navin Shetty, the duo behind festival favourites such as Cargo and Two Sisters and a Husband.\n\nPrivacy examines the use of video surveillance in urban centres while highlighting socio-economic differences in Mumbai. Sudeep added, “The film depicts the compelling truth of access to information. Whether it be CCTV surveillance or gathering someone’s personal data. An individual’s privacy has truly become a luxury in today’s world.”\n\nSince Netflix’s Trial by Fire, this is Rajshri Deshpande’s first major role. Sharing her delight, she said, “As an actor and a social worker, it is very important to me that the script is written sensitively. Privacy talks about mental health issues. It shines the spotlight on how society perceives an individual going through a struggle. It is a beautifully written story and depicts the importance of privacy and how every societal element is exploiting the term.”\n\nAlong with Rajshri, the film stars Nishank Verma, Sandesh Kulkarni, Saurabh Goyal, Chhaya Kadam, Rushad Rana and Sagar Salunke in pivotal roles.

He has managed to shine despite sharing the screen with much bigger stars such as Kamal Haasan, Aamir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nIn fact, City of Dreams is the first time he is playing the lead in a prominent Hindi production. The third season of the Hotstar series released on May 26. The actor plays the power-hungry chief minister of Maharashtra, Ameya Rao Gaikwad, who can go to any extent—even alienate or harm his own family—to hold on to his position. “There’s almost a sinister quality to my character, but he has also been vulnerable right from the opening scene, where he is shot. In the second season, he is disabled, but he always bounces back,” Kulkarni says. In the latest season, his character undergoes a significant transformation. “A series of events fundamentally alter the core of my character, creating a lot of potential for drama, and the writers have exploited that fully,” he adds.\n\nAs is evident from his roles in the over 100 productions he has done across six languages—\nHindi, Marathi, Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil, Kannada––the actor has a visible penchant for grey, menacing characters. He played a Hindu fanatic in Hey Ram, a hot-headed gangster in Chandni Bar, \na cunning politician in Satta, a budding activist in Rang De Basanti, and a crime lord in Raees. But, unlike what actors often say for darker roles, work has never taken a toll on him. Acting, for Kulkarni, is a technique, and nothing more. “If I get affected by intense roles, then I am not doing my job properly. I am supposed to make people believe that I am the character,” he says.\n\n\n\nA poster of City of Dreams\n\n\n\nAgain, contrary to the popular assertion by many in the fraternity, he does not do any research for a film, unless absolutely necessary. “For me, everything begins and ends with the script and, of course, the director, because he is the storyteller,” says the Page 3 actor, adding, “As for preparation, I believe it’s \na 24-hour process; when you are reading books, newspapers, watching films, web shows, talking to people and travelling, you are absorbing.”\n\nKulkarni saw tangible success pretty early. He received the National Award for his first two Hindi films—Hey Ram and Chandni Bar—within four years of starting his career in 1997. When asked if he enjoyed the initial years more than what followed, pat comes the reply, \n\n“I think all phases in an actor’s life are linked. There is no good or bad phase. You learn a lot even when your films don’t do well. I don’t like to think of my career in terms of successful and unsuccessful phases.” If his filmography, of late, is anything to go by, he is certainly in an OTT phase. Following City of Dreams, he will be returning to the small screen with the second season of the musical series, Bandish Bandits, on Amazon Prime. “In the long format, you get so much space to tell your story, and exploit everything you have in your mind,” says the actor, who has also starred in shows such as Sandwiched Forever, Rudra: The Edge of Darkness and Happy Family: Conditions Apply. \n\nLast year, Kulkarni added another feather in his cap. He debuted as a screenwriter for Aamir Khan’s Laal Singh Chaddha. Unfazed by its failure at the box office, the 57-year-old says, “All of us put in a lot of hard work and time because we believed in the story. Despite the outcome, we stand by that.” He adds,  “We all know Aamir; he won’t go ahead with a project unless he is completely convinced. As for me, if I had to \nwrite it again, I will write it the same way.” ",

      "description": "Screenwriter Atika Chohan talks about her upcoming patriotic thriller Ulajh, working with Kanu Behl on Agra and sticking to her guns In Atika Chohan’s biography, whenever it is written, her life would probably be described as a mix of impulses and accidents. It was 2009, 14 years ago when she landed in Mumbai from Delhi to try her luck at screenwriting. “I just had Rs 5000 in the bank,” she reminisces over a video call with us, her ginger-coloured cat sprawling behind a couch’s headrest. Back in Delhi, she was a literature student turned “accidental” journalist, penning articles on art and culture, eventually expanding to interviewing artists. “We had to come up with innovative ways to make those video interviews interesting,” she shares. “During this process, before I even realised it, I was writing for the screen.”\n\nJournalism couldn’t quench her thirst for expression for long, she wanted something more. It wasn’t just a career shift, personal factors were at play too. “I grew up in a dysfunctional setup. I eloped at the age of 21 to marry my college senior. At 25 or 26, I was going through a divorce,” she shares. “I had lived quite an eventful life at such a young age. It was the stuff for novels.”\n\nThe screenwriter has been keeping busy lately. She shares writing credits with filmmaker Kanu Behl on his recent Cannes outing Agra, a surreal take on sexual repression in confined spaces. Up next is Janhvi Kapoor’s Ulajh, billed as a patriotic thriller revolving around the world of Indian Foreign Services. There is also the relationship-drama KNOT which is being produced by British actor Dev Patel.\nThe screenwriter speaks to us about her upcoming projects, her writing life and how to keep one’s ideology intact in the age of chest-thumping nationalism. \n\n\nPic: Ali Monis Naqvi, Atika Chohan\n\n\nAgra made some waves at Cannes this year. You co-wrote the film with Kanu Behl, how did you help shape the story?\nI brought some changes to the narrative and the structure. I think Kanu and I arrived at the idea of correlating space and sexuality. This is the story of a sexually repressed, perverted guy who works at a call centre. We needed a lot of female agency to act as a foil against him. The women needed to have dignity but also a sense of feistiness. I gave my input on making these women understand and use the resources of patriarchy to stay afloat in a male-centric world.\n\nYou have penned the dialogues for Ulajh, which recently commenced shooting. As a screenwriter how do you make interactions between people, from a world you have not experienced first-hand, sound natural?\nI think more than the world, it is important to arrive at the humanity of a character. At its heart, Ulajh is a story of a woman in her late twenties. What challenges does she face? She is a product of a certain kind of childhood, a certain kind of socio-economic experience, a certain kind of privilege or the lack of it. Before going for dialogues, it’s important to position your character in the world. She will have unique blind spots in her character conflating with her identity as an IFS officer. We have to dissect the human first.\n\nIn the current environment, where nationalism sells, when you are writing a patriotic-thriller have you ever been asked to write chest-thumping, nationalistic dialogues?\nNo, at least not for Ulajh. The film’s politics are very clear in the sense that we can be patriots without knowing there is a bigger game at play that is beyond our comprehension.\n\nFor other projects?\nYes. Actually, I had to let go of a project I was very gung-ho about. After the first few drafts, the brief kind of hinted at making the film more nationalistic and I was extremely uncomfortable with that. It was during the time of Covid-19 and things were really tough politically in the country. It was a phase where everybody wanted to portray themselves as more and more nationalistic so that they don’t get left behind. Now, I think the makers, in general, have come back to their senses.\n\nHave you ever lost a project because of your politics?\nThere was a time when I was extremely vocal on Twitter. I didn’t lose a project but I might have gotten less work. I think people need to understand that if I am secular and an idealist that doesn’t mean I want India to lose and Pakistan to win. My brand of nationalism is not about going after Pakistan’s blood.\n\nThis might sound a little philosophical, but where do your ideas come from?\nI guess by living deeply. I keep my eyes and ears open. As I am ageing, I am becoming less prone to judgement. When I hear sexist remarks on the news by our administrators, I feel more curious than angry. I think of where they are coming from, and what history led us here. My ideas come from unpacking the life around me.\n  ",

      "description": "As actor Kangana Ranaut turns producer with Tiku Weds Sheru, she talks about casting a new face to play the female lead in the film, and her idea of success What made you cast Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Sheru? Why didn’t you play the lead opposite him?\nI was clear that I needed an established star to play Sheru, and I had always thought of casting Nawaz sir for the role. I met him for the first time during the narration of the script in Bengaluru, and he agreed to do it immediately. The process of finding the female lead, however, took longer, since I wanted a newcomer to play Tiku. Eventually, Avneet (Kaur) came on board. Once you watch the film, you will realise why we wanted a fresh face for the role. Her character is naïve and not worldly-wise; she is inexperienced and playful. Over and above, I believe the industry needs new actors now, and Avneet totally deserves to be here.\n\nWould you like to star opposite Nawazuddin in the future?\nI would love to work with Nawaz sir. I am a great fan of his, especially his gangster films. His dialogue from Sacred Games––kabhi kabhi lagta hai apun hi bhagwan hai––is quite popular in my family.\n\nIs there a message you want to give your audiences with Tiku Weds Sheru?\nI believe that in our society, we give success a lot of importance, and failure is something that is not permitted. What we don’t acknowledge is that the former comes only after a spate of defeats. The newer generation, though, is growing impatient. They do not understand the significance of struggling. Those who struggle should not be looked down upon. Tiku and Sheru are two such individuals. They are special people and deserve a lot more than what life has handed them.\n\nYou are a two-film-old director (Manikarnika and Emergency) and have now become a producer with Tiku Weds Sheru. How do you look at success in these roles?\nI have just started directing and producing movies. I am yet to prove myself. As far as success goes, for me it is the freedom to be able to choose what I want to do. If one is compelled by their circumstances into doing something that doesn’t make them happy, or they have to suppress their desires, that is not success to me. I feel I am successful because I have the liberty to make and produce the films I want.\n\nYou have bankrolled the film, but did you ever feel that you could step in also as the director, especially before Sai Kabir was signed for the project?\nI could have been the director, but because the story was written by Kabir, I felt he would handle the subject better. I have always believed that writers make good directors. He knew the world he had created well, and I knew he would do justice to the film.\n\nDo you think luck has played any role in your success?\nDefinitely. Hard work is important, but at the same time, I have witnessed magic. I have experienced it at many points in my career, which is why I cannot deny the role of luck. For instance, when Anurag Basu picked me to play the lead in Gangster from among the millions of girls who had auditioned, that was my luck.\n\nThere is a lot of societal pressure on young girls to get married, just as Tiku faces in the film. Did you ever face it while growing up?\nMy mother pressured me all the time. Whenever I did something wrong she would say, ‘How will you find\na husband if you behave like this?’ But, I think if Tiku can find her Sheru, every girl will find a man who appreciates her for her personality, whether she is soft- or outspoken. If you don’t find the right person, it’s better to be on your own rather than be stuck with the wrong partner. I always tell everyone that right now I am in a happy space. My life is 95 per cent complete; if a man can make it 100 per cent, I will marry him. ",

      "description": "Manohar Pandey, who was recently seen as Bali Putra Angad in Adipurush, who has also worked in Super 30 and Gangubai Kathiawadi says Saif always guided and pushed him to achieve. Delhi has long been regarded as a cultural hub, nurturing countless talents and fostering the growth of the performing arts. One such artiste who honed his skills amidst the vibrant theatre scene of the city is Manohar Pandey, who was recently seen as Bali Putra Angad in Adipurush. “Saif Ali Khan helped me a lot in Adipurush, he was always there to guide and push me,” says the actor, who has also worked in Super 30 and Gangubai Kathiawadi. \n\nPandey’s acting journey commenced in the realm of theatre. Having moved to Delhi in 2007, he embarked on a quest to find a theatre group that would allow him to pursue his passion. After an arduous search, he stumbled upon Pierrot’s Troupe, a theatre collective based in Mandi House. Reflecting on his initial encounter, Pandey fondly recalls, “When I started theatre in Delhi, the people I met, the company I had, and the people I spent most of my time with were all very nice to me.\n\nThis helped me become a better person and become a better actor.” Theatre proved to be an invaluable training ground, shaping Pandey both personally and professionally. Working with Pierrot’s Troupe exposed him to the nuances of language and accent, a challenge he adeptly overcame. “It helped me tune my language... acting is somewhere a profession where you have to be flexible yet neutral with one’s language.” The company’s focus on Urdu plays further enhanced his linguistic repertoire, instilling in him a profound appreciation for the beauty of the language.\n\nDuring his time with Pierrot’s Troupe, Pandey engaged in numerous productions, each leaving an indelible mark on his artistic journey. The collaborative efforts and camaraderie within the group enabled him to thrive as an actor. Recounting those memorable moments, he says, “Going back to Pierrot’s Troupe, they used to do a lot of Urdu plays, which suddenly introduced me to Urdu. M Sayeed Alam, the director of the group, used to chide us to improve our delivery.\n\nThis honestly fine-tuned my language.” Pandey’s pursuit continued at the Shri Ram Centre Repertory in New Delhi, where he further refined his craft under the guidance of accomplished directors. Immersed in different production processes, he gained invaluable insights and new-found confidence in his abilities. Describing his experience, he says, “After coming here, I got to work with different directors, which exposed me to different methods of production. After all of this, I got admission to the National School of Drama (NSD) in 2014.”\n\nThe NSD served as the pinnacle of Pandey’s formal training. The institution offered him an unparalleled platform to nurture his acting skills, free from the burdens of daily life. Here, he seized every opportunity to enhance his understanding and proficiency. “The three years at NSD... it’s like whatever you can and want to learn is in your capacity. You don’t have to think about food, shelter, or any other basic struggle as everything is arranged.” \n\nHis collaborations with directors like Vikas Bahl and Sanjay Leela Bhansali has provided invaluable learning experiences, allowing him to grow as an artiste As Pandey’s acting repertoire continues to expand, he has recently embarked on a new venture in the Malayalam film industry. His forthcoming project, Kannur Squad, sees him starring alongside the legendary Mammootty. While details about the film are still unfolding, Pandey’s excitement is palpable. He only shares glimpses of his character, Pawan Bhaiyya, a Hindi-speaking villager whose vital information becomes the focal point of an investigative thriller, and says the rest will unfold with time. \n\nQuick Four\n\n\n\t    Favourite Street Food: Chole Kulche behind Mandi House.\n\t    Favourite place to hang out: The Mandi House area, of course.\n\t    Favourite Monument: Agrasen ki Baoli\n\t    One Lesson from the city: Work hard and be honest with yourself.\n\n\nActor Manohar Pandey, recently seen in Adipurush as Bali Putra Angad, speaks to Ryan Thomas about his transition into the film industry, his collaboration with industry stalwarts and the impact of his training in Delhi ",

      "image": "",
      "description": "Radhika Madan, who is earning laurels for her act in the upcoming film Sanaa, bares it all about her acting process and her next releases.  Despite a predictable start to her acting career in a superhit television soap opera, Aashiqui Tum Se Hi, Radhika Madan chose a very different path of growth for herself, discreetly choosing each role with an eye of an experienced artiste.\n\nIt’s the thrill of getting to live different lives that got her into acting, and Madan’s living her dream by becoming a part of films that have very different tales to tell. After an impressive debut on the big screen with Vishal Bhardwaj’s Pataakha in 2018, Madan has been seen in interesting roles in a variety of films, including Vasan Bala’s Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota and Monica, O My Darling, Homi Adajania’s Angrezi Medium, and more recently, Shiddat and Kuttey.\n\nThis year, her class act in the sports drama, Kacchey Limbu, and web series, Saas, Bahu Aur Flamingo, has been much appreciated by the audience. But the high point is bagging the best actress award at the recently-concluded UK Asian Film Festival for her upcoming film Sanaa. This intense film by Sudhanshu Saria, which had its global premiere at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, follows the story of a headstrong and ambitious Mumbai girl, who is battling an unhealed trauma.\nA young millennial with over 3.5 million followers on Instagram, Madan is adored as much for her eclectic and edgy sense of fashion as for her powerhouse performances. She bares it all about Sanaa, her acting process and her other upcoming films, including Soorarai Pottru’s remake co-starring Akshay Kumar, Happy Teacher’s Day and Rumi Ki Sharafat.\n\nYou just won the best actress award for Sanaa  at UK Asian Festival. Did you expect it?\nWe didn’t expect it at all; we only wanted to share our film with a wider audience. But the response we got was really overwhelming. We got a lot of hugs; we shared a lot of tears; and we shared each other’s experiences, and it was such a collective emotion in the room felt with the audience. That was more special to me and the award was the cherry on the cake. It was the toughest role for me to crack so far and the closest to my heart. I can’t wait for the world to see it.\n\nWe loved how you channelled so much sass in Saas, Bahu Aur Flamingo.\nIt was so exciting to shoot the series and collaborate with Homi Adajania, who is such a joy. He empowers women, and it’s a treat to be on that set and just be surrounded by some amazing actors and veterans like Dimple Kapadia. She is so humble and is a masterclass in acting. It was overwhelming that Kacchey Limbu also released after a while and people appreciated me for playing two varied characters from different age groups.\n\nWhat lessons did you pick up in your journey as an actor?\nTo be patient; patience is the key and you cannot rush into things. I came from nowhere and lived in the city alone; it has been such a beautiful journey for me. It completely changed me as a human being. I’ve become more empathetic, more sensitive and my family sees that difference and they are like ‘Wow! What a change in you’. The projects and the people I’m collaborating with are making me grow as a person. The other lesson is – just trust your gut and jump into the pool of uncertainty, which might scare you but that’s how you grow. So, I am actually looking for projects that scare me the most and make me think, ‘How the hell am I going to do this’. \n\nHailing from a non-filmy background, has the struggle been more than the Nepo-kids? \nI think I am more of a ‘what I have in me, and what do I have in my favour’ kind of person. I am very aware of the other side of it, but I just look at what I have. I am extremely grateful for all the opportunities and give my all to them. I would never trade my journey with someone else and I’m extremely proud of my journey and transformation.\n\nWhat inspires you?\nSeeing the world through a different eye really excites me. I like the thought processes and perspectives, which are really different than mine. Anyone around me, right from my house help to my driver, to my friends, family and management staff, is a protagonist in their own story. I like listening to their stories of struggle and keep making mental notes of them. I try to be non-judgmental and receptive to different thought processes.\n\nDo you believe in method acting or are you a spontaneous actor?\nThat depends from project to project. I love my prep time and I don’t want to deny that the more days you give me the better it is. I like sitting with my director and going deep into the character, but it also shifts from genre to genre. I feel comedy comes out really well if you are not over-rehearsed – spontaneity really works there. So, for films like Feels Like Ishq and Rumi Ki Sharafat, you can’t be over-prepared; you just need to trust your instincts and go with the flow. But projects like Saas, Bahu Aur Flamingo, Sanaa and even Kacchey Limbu needed deep preparations and I gave as many days as I could to get into the skin of each character. During Kacchey Limbu, I prepped for three to four hours every day for three to four months. I needed to learn how to spin (a cricket ball) and it was such a joy revisiting childhood.\n\nDo you ever feel like doing theatre?\nAny medium works for me if the script is great and exciting enough to scare and challenge me. I am just happy to live a different life on any medium. I ask myself this question: ‘How am I going to do this?’ If that question pops up and it is exciting, I just say, yes. I also avoid repeating a character and try to offer something new to the audience every single time. I remember, after acting in Pataakha, I was offered many village girl characters and at that point, I said no because I became an actor to live different lives. So, I just waited for Angrezi Medium to come, so that I can break that image. Later, I broke that kid’s image too by doing a film like Shiddat, and even playing a godmother like Didi in Ray. I like breaking moulds that people put me in by trying something new.\n\nYour upcoming projects?\nSoorarai Pottru’s remake is a really special project, and working with Akshay Kumar and Sudha has been great. I learnt a lot of things. Happy Teacher’s Day is with Nimrat Kaur, and it has a social message, while Rumi Ki Sharafat is a comedy and sees me in a new avatar.\n\nYour fashion choices?\nLike films, in fashion too, I love experimenting a lot. I like to wear different silhouettes and colours. I even tell my stylist to try and find different silhouettes or colours for me. What I wear also depends on how I am feeling on that particular day or what the occasion is. I don’t stick to one colour or designer label. I love the language of every designer and don’t mind trying their designs. So, I’m pretty open when it comes to fashion.\n\nYour diet and fitness regimens?\nI’ve been a vegan for a few years now, and the journey of turning into a vegan has really changed my life. My thoughts have become clearer; I feel way lighter and my body shape has changed. I have become way more energetic too. I eat a variety of veggies, fruits, seeds, and legumes and start my day with sattu shakes. I have chole, rajma and daal and I am no longer fearful of carbs. I found the right balance and I only go for clean ingredients. I avoid refined oil and white sugar, instead, go for cold-pressed oils like coconut or mustard. I’ve replaced sugar with date jaggery.\n\nI have opted for different fitness regimens like martial arts, swimming, aerial yoga, cross-fit and weight training for different films. I love shifting gears and switching it up and doing things that challenge my body. One thing that I practice daily is kriya yoga, and it has changed my life. I do it every single day and the rest of the exercises depend upon the kind of character I  am playing.  ",

      "image": "",
      "description": "Actor Ronit Roy, who has had three big-ticket releases this year, including Bloody Daddy, says he is only getting started Actor Ronit Roy is everywhere. Of late, he has emerged as directors’ favourite for meaty supporting roles. This year alone, he has played father to Kartik Aryan in Shehzada, a vengeful police officer in Aditya Roy Kapoor’s Gumraah, and most recently, a drug lord in Shahid Kapoor-starrer action thriller Bloody Daddy. “The main reason I did Bloody Daddy was to work with (director) Ali Abbas Zafar. I have always admired him. Secondly, my role in the Hindi adaptation is much larger than the French original, Sleepless Night. It is more dramatically played out and the character has an edge to it,” he says. \n\nThat, however, does not mean that the actor takes up every part that comes his way. In fact, he admits having refused a project “every 15 days” in recent times. He says, “The problem with casting now is that for typical roles, they shortlist three or four actors. Then they simply try to sign any one of them, irrespective of what the character demands.” Recalling that he even declined a Christopher Nolan (of Batman fame) film for similar reasons, the actor adds, “The part was too insignificant. I don’t want to just fill spaces; it is insulting to my craft.”  \n\n\n\nRonit Roy in Bloody Daddy\n\n\n\nThe journey to the point where he has the liberty and conviction to pick and choose roles was not easy. Roy has had a roller-coaster ride in showbiz. His debut film Jaan Tere Naam (1992) had a dream run of 25 weeks, but it was not followed by equally good opportunities. What finally got him into the limelight was playing a grey-shaded businessman in Ekta Kapoor’s tele soap, Kasautii Zindagii Kay in the 2000s. \n\nA decade later, he delivered yet another unforgettable performance in Vikramaditya Motwane’s Udaan. \n“I made wrong choices and did not have a good film for several years. So, it’s been a rough ride, but in the end it turned out just fine,” he says.\n\n\n\nGumraah\n\n\n\nWith a three-decade-long career, Roy is undeniably a seasoned actor. He has done TV, commercial films (Student Of the Year, Kaabil, 2 States) and parallel cinema (Anurag Kashyap’s That Girl in Yellow Boots and Midnight’s Children by Deepa Mehta). He also forayed into Telugu film industry in 2017 with NTR Jr-starrer Jai Lava Kusa. He made his OTT debut four years ago with crime drama, Line of Descent, and went on to star in acclaimed projects such as Bhoomi and Hostages.\n\n“I have worked across formats, but my career is pretty much the same even after OTT. I am taking small steps and doing good work,” he says. Roy will be next seen playing the lead in a film, titled Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo. The middle-age love story will also star Paoli Dam and Sonali Kulkarni. There is also Bade Miyan Chote Miyan with Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff, scheduled for release later this year. “Then, I will be hosting crime drama series and I also have two web shows,” he adds.  \n\nEvidently, the 57-year-old actor is only getting started, and has a long career bucket list—from venturing into international cinema to attending “the biggest award ceremonies in the world”. “Right now, I am in the best shape of my life. My diet, fitness, everything is in order, and I am inclined to better myself each day. I have another 25-30 years ahead of me, and that’s a long time,” he says. ",

      "image": "",
      "description": "We speak with the actor on finding the perfect glasses for the role, discuss her cooking skills and her thoughts on veg biryani.  Huma Qureshi has had a long-standing relationship with food. After her debut in Gangs of Wasseypur (2012), the same year she went on to play a part in Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana, a film in which she is on a quest to find the secret ingredient in the titular dish (spoiler: it’s marijuana). Last year there was Double XL which showed an obese Huma munching under stress. “I have so many amazing people around me who cook incredibly well,” she tells us over a chat. Her father Saleem Qureshi is a restaurateur behind Saleem’s, a popular food joint in Delhi serving Mughlai cuisine since 1977.\n\nFor her latest, Tarla, she has donned the chef’s cap to portray Tarla Dalal, the late celebrity cook and Padma Shri awardee. It’s her first biopic. We speak with the actor about finding the perfect glasses for the role, discuss her cooking skills and her thoughts on veg biryani. \nExcerpts:\n\nYou look uncannily similar to Tarla Dalal in the film’s trailer. Was it tough to shoot while wearing the dentures?\nOh, they were quite uncomfortable (laughs). The dentures would sometimes fall off while I was speaking or would get stuck to my incisors. But they were necessary because her (Tarla’s) teeth were slightly bigger than mine. I needed them in order to get that big, toothy, Tarla smile. I had to go through a transformation in other ways too. There were the saris and the glasses. I remember going through hundreds of pairs to find the glasses Tarla ji would wear and which would also compliment my face.\n\nThis is also your first biopic. How did you decide to approach it?\nI went for it in a very real, granular manner. I wanted people to see my performance and say ‘Oh that’s not Huma, that’s Tarla’. I think when an actor is able to capture that, then doing a biopic becomes fun. The last time I saw somebody catch that essence was Ranveer (Singh) in 83 (he played Kapil Dev in the film). I guess I want to do more biopics, maybe a sportsperson or a yesteryear actress.\n\nWhile playing a real-life person, how do you distance yourself from imitating them and ultimately portraying them as a character?\nThe idea is to not do a caricature but a homage. I didn’t want to mimic Tarla ji. The approach was to empathise with her. I thought about where she comes from, what would be her first thought in the morning, what would be her first task of the day, and things like that. It’s easier to do an over-the-top portrayal of this Gujarati woman. Sewing in humour is important too but I wanted people to laugh with the character and not at it.\n\nTarla Dalal demystified some elite cuisines and brought them to middle-class households. She also ‘vegetarianised’ many meat dishes. But there has always been this opinion that not every non-veg dish can have a vegetarian alternative. For example, people still debate over the existence of veg biryani. What is your take on that?\nOk, you have put me into a dharm sankat (dilemma). Should I promote the film or speak the truth? (laughs). See, now, biryani can’t be without meat. I mean call it pulao if it only has tomato, carrots and peas. There is nothing called veg biryani. But what Tarla ji did in her cooking was quite interesting. She took the chicken out of the Murgh Musallam and added batata (potato). It interested my father, who has been a staunch meat chef since the 1970s, so much that he added this Batata Musallam to his restaurant’s (Saleem’s) menu.\n\nSince the film revolves around food and you come from a family that has been in the restaurant business for years, I have to ask this. Does cooking interest you?\nI am interested in cooking up a storm (laughs). No, I can’t cook but I am the guinea pig who has to taste everybody else’s recipes.\n\nStill, any cooking skill you caught on while shooting?\nI don’t want to flex but I can make a perfect, round roti. It’s like a god-given talent (laughs).\n\nIs there a favourite cuisine?\nI am more like a dal chawal, pyaaz and ghee sort of person. I like going to people’s houses and eating home-cooked food. Anything cooked with love, I’ll gobble up. Lately, I have been fancying Thai curries.\n\nLast year was a mix bag for you. There was Double XL which didn’t perform well but you got acclaim for your performances in Monica, O My Darling and Maharani. When it comes to career, what mental space are you in?\nIt was sad when Double XL didn’t do well at the box office, more so because I was attached to the project also as a producer. But I was happy that it received love on OTT along with Monica… I am just having fun, getting to play different characters. So yeah, I guess I am in a good, healthy mind space.\n\nHuma Qureshi deconstructs the process of playing celebrity cook Tarla Dalal, lists what other biopics she wants to do and opines on veg biryani\n  ",

      "title": "Cinema should represent all kinds of people: Rohit Mittal",
      "image": "",
      "description": "The Mumbai-based independent filmmaker behind films such as Autohead, Popcity and Megalopolis talks about the current state of indie cinema in the country, the need for honesty in storytelling. Remember when, over a decade ago, filmmakers like Anurag Kashyap and Dibakar Banerjee got young film buffs as excited in India’s independent film movement as the young generation that witnessed the birth of the Hollywood New Wave (Easy Rider, Midnight Cowboy) and the early 90s (Reservoir Dogs, El Mariachi)? These filmmakers’ rebellious spirit almost compelled one to go out and buy a camera. Unfortunately, the indie film scene today doesn’t generate the same level of excitement, despite the existence of highly talented names such as Avinash Arun (Killa), Vikramaditya Motwane (Udaan), Achal Mishra (Gamak Ghar), Chaitanya Tamhane (Court) or Arati Kadav (Cargo). \n\nWhat gives? Are today’s filmmakers not as passionate? I ask up-and-coming Mumbai-based filmmaker Rohit Mittal, whose name, I feel, deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the above names. But, first, some background... \n\n\nPopcity\n\n\nFollowing a brief disillusioning stint as a lawyer, Rohit got enrolled in Los Angeles’ New York Film Academy, after which he managed to land an internship gig with the legendary Roger Corman, the man who played a big part in launching the careers of mavericks like Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Jonathan Demme, and Peter Bogdanovich. A filmmaker with a distinctive voice, Rohit, in his films Autohead, Popcity, and Megalopolis, exhibits an affinity towards dark humour and sharp social commentary without resorting to preachiness. To give a brief picture: in Autohead (2016), a film crew documenting an autorickshaw driver (a brilliantly unnerving Deepak Sampat) is taken for a nightmarish ride when they discover he is a serial killer; in Popcity (2021), a South Indian contract killer (a funny and compelling Arjun Radhakrishnan) navigates existential crisis, bad relationships and botched assignments. \n\nAs his new film Demons, a relationship drama, does the rounds in the festival circuit, we sat down with the 36-year-old filmmaker to talk about the current state of indie cinema in the country, the need for honesty in storytelling, and more...\n\nExcerpts: \n\nHow do you look at the evolution of the indie film scene in India as opposed to the early 2000s? Are the filmmakers not as angry anymore? \nA sense of complacency has crept in—for various reasons. Back then, not only were people ready to take more risks, there was more passion and love for movies. Moviemaking changed when the corporates got bigger and even the producers turned to them for funding, in which case, people do what the funders tell them to do. It’s not that you can’t make good movies under the studio system—The Godfather is one great exception—but I feel the basic love for cinema is sorely lacking. It has become a problem of numbers with these corporates. When everything becomes about bulk, the quality suffers as a result. Besides, there is no innovation in marketing. \n\nThat said, I’m still hopeful because as long as there exist people who are passionate about movies and making them, exploring new stories and storytelling, and if we have more such people on both sides, be it the producers, directors or writers, then we can keep that fire burning. \n\nWhat are the pitfalls of this ‘committee filmmaking’?\nWhen you hire someone to make something, let him do his job. When a lot of meddling happens, the singular voice gets lost, and you end up with a half-baked product. And I’m not dismissing the role of producers because all these great classics we talk about wouldn’t have happened without them. We hardly give credit to them. But when it comes to indie filmmaking, the entire idea is to explore new voices and new storytelling possibilities. \n\nWhat has been happening with indie cinema in the last 7-8 years is filmmakers trying to cater to a certain type of festival audience, and the festivals themselves are playing it safe in terms of the kind of films they select. The most notable quality of the 90s independent film movement in Hollywood was the sheer variety. There were films like El Mariachi, Reservoir Dogs, Sex, Lies and Videotape, The Blair Witch Project, and many more. Over here, what has happened is a select few think indie cinema should be in a certain way. As a result, the market also suffered for indie films because we didn’t give them any variety. When competing with multiple platforms, including YouTube, we have to expand our imagination. \n\nDo you think some films suffer because they adhere to a ‘woke’ checklist?\nThat, yes, and even in terms of aesthetics... trying to make a film look a certain way to appeal to a certain group. Here’s the problem with that. A film may premiere at Sundance or Berlin, but do they find an audience later? After a point, you start wondering whom to blame —the festivals or the filmmakers? Catering to some 1500 people and their ideas of what a film should be is unhealthy. It feels as though the festivals themselves have taken the onus of bringing these few ideologies forward, which was not the case in the 70s, 80s, or 90s. Back then, it was more about the movies themselves than making something just to espouse a certain social cause. \n\nHow do you feel about OTT platforms picking up independent films and then taking them off after a certain period? How do filmmakers get paid?\nThey get paid, yes, but peanuts. The way these OTT platforms pick content is disappointing. When they first came in, they showed an interest in all the so-called ‘good content’, but later on, they probably felt that there was no market for these films, or they felt the urge to expand and ended up joining hands with the biggies, post which they started following the old format—getting as many big names as possible for everything. When the pandemic hit, they hardly looked at smaller films; all their budgets went into acquiring the relatively bigger films and shows. They bought and bought and eventually realised there was an oversupply of everything.\n\nYour films discuss voyeurism, sensation-hungry media, sexual repression, and racism, among other things, yet the way you incorporate them feels very organic—a rarity today.\nMy films came out of a lot of anger. For example, in Autohead, my anger is directed towards poverty porn filmmakers and people who record cruel acts instead of helping the individual in peril. My films also question the typical image of a movie ‘hero’. I feel there is a severe underrepresentation of authentic, flawed male characters in the films made in the last 5-7 years. It’s either these big mainstream heroes behaving like idealistic superheroes or these really ‘feminised’ versions of men in the so-called ‘woke’ cinema. The world has all kinds of people... and our films should represent everyone.\n  ",

When Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla believes in something, they honour that belief with flair, flamboyance and of course, fashion. One of their core values has always been to, ‘unapologetically be who you are.’ To take pride and claim your personal power and that’s what the recently released Pride-themed Satrangi campaign is all about — a celebration of all our colours in all our glory. “As creators, designers and human beings, we aim to enable a discrimination-free world. We believe in the power of Pride because authenticity, a good heart and genuine talent can be found in anyone no matter what their preferences are. The Satrangi Campaign celebrates identity, inclusivity and community, a belonging beyond birth — with style,” opens Sandeep Khosla.\n\nThe video was shot at Suzzane Khan’s The Charcoal Project and stars Sonali Bendre and Goldie Behl, drag queen/activist Sushant Divgikar and writer-director Mozez Singh among others. “As a society, the sooner we normalise non-judgmental acceptance, the better our world will be. In Satrangi, Abu Sandeep has presented serious ideas in a light, wholesome way and we are glad to have been a part of it,” adds Sonali Bendre.\n\nFeaturing garments from their eponymous couture label and prêt line, Gulabo, the collection represents an extravagant ode to Pride where rainbow colours dance over canvases of solid black and white.\n\nThe colourful concept is expressed through couture and art in scrupulous detail with pride-coloured bejewelled briefs, buttons, roses, beads, striped collars, heart motifs and exaggerated bows, pleats, drapes and ruffles.\n\nFrom subtle to bold, every detail reflects and honours individual preferences. We caught up with the director of the video, Siddharth Jain — known for his work with Gauri Khan, Masaba, Deepika Padukone and Sonam Kapoor Ahuja — to find out more about what went into creating this fabulous fashion-meets-LGBTQIA+ Pride campaign.\n\nTell us how Satrangi happened.\n\njust recovered from a year-long surgery and bed rest. Sandeep Khosla and Saudamini Mattu (CEO, Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla) told me two days before the shoot that they are hosting a sort of tea party to celebrate Pride. I asked them: what if we make a film around a tea party gone wrong? You know, like when something goes wildly but beautifully wrong. I didn’t think much of it and just said it. AJSK (Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla) being AJSK loved it and pushed for it and one day before the shoot we prepared the script and made the video. No one celebrates love like Abu and Sandeep!\n\nHow did you decide to treat the video, considering this was queer-themed?\n\nAs one does, I asked my assistant directors and the team to find a few references for what I had in mind but they didn’t find anything similar to what I wanted to do. Luckily for me, Sandeep had already gotten the song made from Burudu (Sahil Bhatia & Nakul Sharma). Once I heard the song, I immediately knew what I wanted it to be — unabashed and unashamed and then the fabulous people in the film created pure magic. My brief for this film was it has to be about non-conformity, acceptance and a celebration of love and I think we did a great job at portraying just that. This was a film I always wanted to make.\n\nWhat did you want the audience to take away from Satrawngi?\n\nI want the audience to unshackle their minds. It’s not just enough to be okay or say I get this or that I wanted to give them an ‘in.’ I wanted to portray how amazing it feels to be an ally and be in the middle of things and just be confident, a confidante and celebrate together!\n\nWho are your biggest inspirations?\nMy mother, Abu and Sandeep and just so many strong people I’ve been lucky enough to come\nacross.\n\nSatrangi is streaming on the official Instagram ID of AJSK\n(Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla): @abujanisandeepkhosla ",

It was wonderful to return to our weird, dysfunctional family again and play these characters, but knowing that this is the last one definitely made it emotional. There was a lot of laughter and tears. I think we really felt the fact that it was the end of an era for all of us.\n\nHow did you prepare to play a character like Nebula compared to the other, more normal, roles of yours in films such as The Call of the Wild or Jumanji?\nMy process has always been the same, whether it’s an alien, otherworldly character like Nebula, or a human, who is probably way cooler than I am in real life. It’s all about suppressing my natural impulses to play a part.\n\nWhat is your take on Nebula’s journey as a character since the first Guardians of the Galaxy, almost a decade ago?\nShe has changed a lot. She started off very bitter and angry, but over the course of three films, she has developed a personality of her own through everything she has been through. She’s still tough and aggressive, but I’ve loved introducing a little more humour and levity to her persona. In this one, you really feel how connected she is to the other Guardians, and how she sees them as her family. It’s \na huge transformation from the first volume, where she was a sadistic and tortured person, who did not know how to love or be loved.\n\n\n\nGillan as Nebula \n\n\n\nIn Avengers: Endgame, we saw Nebula kill her past self. How has she come to terms with that?\nI think she is actually fine with it (laughs). It was a cathartic experience; like killing the version of herself she disliked, once and for all.\n\nIn the latest film, we see you carry a lifeless Chris Pratt. Was that difficult?\nI didn’t actually have to carry Chris. It was this amazing and freakishly life-like Chris Pratt doll. \nIt had hair and everything! \nSo, I didn’t have to actually lift him, but it was still pretty heavy.\n\nWill Poulter joins the cast in the latest instalment as Adam Warlock. Tell us about working with him.\nHe is brilliant. His character is neither a villain, nor a hero, but it was fun to go up against someone as powerful as that. \n\nHow would you sum up the last 10 years and your career since joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe?\nIt’s been incredible. I had no idea that it would last this long. When I signed up, I thought it would be eight days of filming, and then they would kill off the character for good, but here I am, an official Guardian! \n\nI couldn’t be more grateful for the opportunity, and the support from the fans. And James Gunn; he gave me a career in films in America. He is a wonderful director and one of the most caring people \nI have come across in my life. He created a Guardians family, both on and off screen.\n\nLooking back, what has been your favourite Nebula scene?\nThere are so many. There’s the one where Nebula fights past Nebula; that was fun. There’s also my monologue about what Thanos did to me in the second film, and the scene with Zoe Saldana (Gamora) when Nebula tells her how all she wanted was  a sister. I have basically just loved playing the character.\n\nBesides the Guardians of  the Galaxy, you have been involved with other franchise films such as Doctor Who and Jumanji. Which character are you recognised as the most by fans?\nWeirdly, it’s Nebula.

      "description": "The lines that made the new Spiderman movie possible stemmed from the hands of a few tech heads who hail from Kerala. TNIE traverses the depths of the multiverse to catch up with them. BENGALURU:  While talking to international media ahead of the theatrical release of Spider-man : Across the Spider-Verse a few weeks ago, the films’ three directors — Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers and Justin K Thompson — had assured fans of the franchise would offer a visual treat, with new worlds and the introduction of exciting characters.\n\nThey kept their promise. The film has incorporated various animation styles to highlight each world, including paint on glass, realistic cartoons, Japanese manga, and even the texture of ’70s comic books published in India to depict the character of Pavitr Prabhakar, aka the desi Spiderman.\n\nThis feat was made possible by a band of animators, who hail from God’s Own Country. They are senior animators Nideep Varghese from Ranni in Pathanamthitta, Harinarayan Rajeev from Poojappura in Thiruvananthapuram and Sinu Raghavan from Urulikunnam in Kottayam, senior software engineer Kurian Onnunny Samuel from Pattazhy in Kottarakkara, and senior software pipeline technical directors Binku Mathews, who is settled in Hyderabad, and Joseph Tom Neriamparampil from Changanassery in Kottayam.\n\nCurrently based in Canada, the six-member team worked on the movie whilst at Sony Pictures Imageworks (SPI ) , Vancouver. Nideep, who had worked on Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse, the first instalment of the trilogy, expressed delight at the chance to work on the franchise again. “The film centres around Miles Morales and Gwen Stacey’s valiant efforts to save their fellow Spiderpeople from a formidable villain who goes by the name Spot,” he says.\n\n“We were enrolled in the project three years ago and had been working on it until April 2023. For me, who grew up reading comic books and making fan animations of Spiderman since childhood, it was a dream come true. Though we were given rough storyboards, I didn’t read them. I only watched the whole movie when it was released in theatres. I wanted to enjoy it like any other Spiderman fan.”\n\nNideep’s primary contributions were to establishing Spot, one of the film’s most fascinating characters, in terms of animation style. In the comics, Spot was always portrayed as a living painting, his body very much in a liquid state. For Harinarayan, a senior animator who was involved in the character development of Spot, the task was an exploration of all the animation skills in his arsenal.\n\n“I had to participate in the character development of Spot from the initial stages of production,” he explains. “Spot, voiced by Jason Schwartzman, is a really stylised and innovative character whose movements are inspired mostly by pantomime as he does not have a face. I got opportunities to conduct a lot of animation experiments to fine-tune Spot.\n\nIt is definitely one of the biggest highlights of my career.” According to Nideep, who is now employed in Dreamworks Animation, an animator not only has to draw and structure the character but also has to evolve and act in the role to conceive it in the right form. “I had to construct the emotions and actions of Spot.\n\nSo, I had to act, record it, and send it to the team’s head to get approval to create the same,” he says. “Animators who worked in the movie required intense knowledge of acting, body mechanics, technical expertise, and a good sense of artistic appeal.” Harinarayan, who is also the animation supervisor in the upcoming Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, adds that each character in the film was animated at a different frame rate.\n\n“It was a challenge for us to animate each character in its distinct art style, exactly like how it is in the comic strips. Each pose required a lot of attention,” he says. Kurian, a senior software engineer, primarily assisted in the creation of various tools for the animation studio and data management, critical tools development and related software solutions. “The first challenge before us was implementing variable frame rates,” he says. “Normally, films use 24 frames per second, but we moved away from the norm and employed different frame rates in several action sequences.”\n\nBinku and Joseph , who served as senior software pipeline technical directors in the team, ensured the project’s smooth operation by identifying and rectifying the issues of each department. Notably, Kurian, Harinarayan, and Nideep began their career with Toonz Animation Studio in Thiruvananthapuram. However, the team laments the lack of technical know-how to create big-budget animation movies in India. “The industry here (in India) runs in a hierarchical manner.\n\nIdeas and views are not cherished here,” says Nideep. “However, in Canada, during the making of Pavitr Prabhakar, we Indian animators felt that the dubbing for the character did not have an Indian essence. When we alerted our team head, they considered our opinions and even made changes.”\n\nNideep also rues the fact that despite the large amounts of money thrown into projects in India, the animation employed lacks quality. “There isn’t a professional animation culture yet,” he adds. He, however, is delighted at the Spiderman film’s success in Kerala. “I got emotional watching people throng the theatres. Our viewing culture has changed. Animations are no longer just children’s stuff,” says Nideep.\n\nAce in the pack\nHarinarayan Rajeev, who is the animation supervisor of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, which will have its theatrical release in India on June 9, spills the beans on the film, too. “As the animation supervisor of the movie, I led a team of 40 animators in Canada and India,” he says.\n\n“The film aims to cater to all generations of Transformers fans by introducing the G1 designs and a new group of Transformers called the Maximals, who can transform into animal forms. Voiced by Ron Perlman, Primal can transform into a giant gorilla, while Air Razor, voiced by Michelle Yeoh, transforms into an eagle.\n\nCheetor and Rhinox are also set to make their appearance in the film.” Notably, Harinarayan has also worked as an animator in films such as Venom 2, Maleficent 2, Kung Fu Panda, Trolls, and Avengers Infinity War.

      "description": "The 85-year-old former \"Cosby Show\" star has now been accused of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment by more than 60 women. LAS VEGAS: Nine more women are accusing Bill Cosby of sexual assault in a lawsuit that alleges he used his \"enormous power, fame and prestige\" to victimize them. \n\nA lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Nevada alleges that the women were individually drugged and assaulted between approximately 1979 and 1992 in Las Vegas, Reno and Lake Tahoe homes, dressing rooms and hotels. \n\nOne woman alleges that Cosby, claiming to be her acting mentor, lured her from New York to Nevada, where he drugged her in a hotel room with what he had claimed to be non-alcoholic sparkling cider and then raped her. \n\nThe 85-year-old former \"Cosby Show\" star has now been accused of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment by more than 60 women. He has denied all allegations involving sex crimes. He was the first celebrity tried and convicted in the #MeToo era, and spent nearly three years at a state prison near Philadelphia before a higher court threw out the conviction and released him in 2021. \n\nEarlier this year, a Los Angeles jury awarded USD 500,000 to a woman who said Cosby sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion when she was 16 in 1975. \n\nThe Nevada lawsuit came only a few weeks after Gov. Joe Lombardo signed a bill that eliminated a two-year deadline for adults to file sexual abuse cases. Similar suits have followed other \"lookback laws\" in other states. \n\nOne of the plaintiffs, Lise-Lotte Lublin, a Nevada native, had advocated for the change. She had previously alleged that Cosby gave her spiked drinks and raped her at a Las Vegas hotel in 1989. The Associated Press does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly. \n\n\"For years I have fought for survivors of sexual assault and today is the first time I will be able to fight for myself,\" Lotte-Lublin said in a statement cited by the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\n\"With the new law change, I now have the ability to take my assailant Bill Cosby to court. My journey has just begun, but I am grateful for this opportunity to find justice,\" she added.\n\nIn California, a former Playboy model who alleges Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her and another woman at his home in 1969, sued him on June 1 under a new California law that suspends the statute of limitations on sex abuse claims. \n\nCosby publicist Andrew Wyatt blasted such laws in a statement Wednesday. \n\n\"Mr Cosby is a Citizen of these United States but these judges and lawmakers are consistently allowing these civil suits to flood their dockets, knowing that these women are not fighting for victims, but for their addiction to massive amounts of media attention and greed,\" Wyatt said. \n\n\"From this day forward, we will not continue to allow these women to parade various accounts of an alleged allegation against Mr Cosby anymore without vetting them in the court of public opinion and inside of the courtroom,\" Wyatt said. \n\nIn the latest suit, the women said Cosby, \"used his enormous power, fame, and prestige, and claimed interest in helping them and/or their careers as a pretence to isolate and sexually assault them.\" \n\n ",

      "title": "Caught in the crossfire of religion with Marco Bellocchio’s Italian film Rapito  ",
      "image": "",
      "description": "Inspired by Daniele Scalise’s book Il cao Mortara, the film begins in the 1850s when Mortara, the sixth child of a Jewish family is abducted by the Papal States to get raised as a Catholic in Rome. The innocence of a child can lay bare the compassionate side of religion that the adult world tends to complicate and turn into a site of conflicts. In Marco Bellocchio’s Italian film Rapito (Kidnapped), a young Jewish boy named Edgardo Mortara, says the prayer of Israel in a Catholic church, just as he regards the holy cross as a good luck charm and looks towards the statue of Christ for a sense of comfort and security. There are no divisions or distinctions between the two faiths in his mind, even as the film is about the two fighting to possess him and his soul.\n\nInspired by Daniele Scalise’s book Il cao Mortara, the film begins in the 1850s when Mortara, the sixth child of a Jewish family is abducted by the Papal States to get raised as a Catholic in Rome. All because he had been secretly baptized as a child, an act that can’t be annulled, and hence he is forbidden to be raised amid people of a different belief even if they are his own.\n\nBellocchio crafts a strong, sturdy, beautifully mounted, energetic, and engaging film though not quite the top of the heap in the official competition section of the Cannes Film Festival. Tension, drama, and emotions propel the narrative in equal measure. The film flows like a thriller that gradually mutates into an exploration of human predicaments and vicissitudes of life and the unspoken tragedies that they can engender. Bellocchio goes about telling the story in a straightforward, linear, and at times heavy-handed fashion, starting with the kidnapping itself. In the kidnapping sequence, we could vividly see the disbelief of the family, their sense of violation, and the heartbreak of the forcible separation from their child for no fault of their own.\n\nThere’s a lot at stake for the Church itself. Will it be seen in a bad light? Will the Saviour be perceived as a criminal? Will it be questioned for antisemitism? What of the authority of the Pope himself? And the media outcry?\n\nBut the most heart-tugging is the plight of the child himself as he becomes the arena of this theological tussle. To put up a brave front before his father and mother but not being able to cross over to where he truly belongs and go back to being with them. Enea Sala’s performance as the young Mortara is virtuoso beyond his age, especially in the scene where he meets the mother, can’t hold back his tears, and tells her that he still recites the Jewish prayer every night. With as clear a conscience, he goes about removing the iron spikes from the statue of Jesus, hoping to bring comfort to an alien figure that has been bringing him succor in turbulent times. There is no either-or in his heart and mind, it’s where the irreconcilables come together and co-exist in peace.\n\nAs the child stays caught in the crossfire of religion, Italy goes through a political transformation, with forces of democracy pitted against the papacy. A much-needed rift emerges between the Church and its power-hungry Pope as opposed to the state.\n\nSlowly the film takes a different turn to become all about the power of persuasion. Mortara moves on from his past, growing up to renounce his family and embrace Christianity. The enormity of his loss hits home in the finale, worsened by the understanding that people could be voluntarily oblivious to the tragedies in their own lives. And that’s essentially the lesson to take back from the film. There can be no winners in the fights of faith and fanaticism.\n\nCinema Without Borders\nIn this weekly column, the writer introduces you to powerful cinema from across the world\n\nFilm: Rapito (Kidnapped)\n  ",

      "image": "",
      "description": "From innovative to provocative, BET has played a crucial role in creating several influential programs that helped spread hip-hop to millions of homes across the globe. LOS ANGELES: “Rap City.” “106 & Park.” And even, “Uncut.”\n\nFrom innovative to provocative, BET has played a crucial role in creating several influential programs that helped spread hip-hop to millions of homes across the globe. Other than its rival show “Yo! MTV Raps,” the network known as Black Entertainment Television took up the mantle — despite some reluctance — to showcase a misunderstood rap culture decades before it became today’s most popular music genre.\n\nFor many, BET became a safe place for those within hip-hop to express their artistry, although not without criticism. Through it all, the network has been a mainstay for established and emerging rap artists.\n\nIt will all come together during the BET Awards on Sunday. Show officials plan to celebrate the genre’s 50th anniversary during the telecast dubbed as a “non-stop Hip-Hop Party.” It also comes at a pivotal time for the network, which will be soon be sold. Several Black entrepreneurs and celebrities, including Tyler Perry, media executive Byron Allen and rapper-entrepreneur Diddy, are interested in purchasing the network.\n\nThe new owner will acquire an important cultural fixture, one whose success was partially built on how it elevated hip-hop.\n\n“BET was a big platform for hip-hop and urban music overall,” said E-40. His song “Tired of Being Stepped On” with the rap group The Click appeared on BET’s “Video Soul,” which was created in 1981 at a time when MTV refused to play videos by most African Americans. The rapper recalled how guest host Jamie Foxx dissed The Click’s song but the comedian’s critical words didn’t faze him. He felt his group gained important exposure to promote their “unorthodox” West Coast rap style.\n\n“The network really stepped up. We needed that,” said E-40, who also made a few appearances on another BET show called “Rap City,” which featured hip-hop music videos, interviews and freestyles booth sessions with big names including Jay-Z, Lil Wayne and MC Lyte. The show, which highlighted popular and up-and-coming rappers, became the longest-running hip-hop TV show in history.\n\nE-40 credited BET founder Robert Johnson for giving hip-hop a chance. Johnson built the brand into the leading TV network for Black Americans in hopes of creating content geared toward jazz, comedy and gospel. But at the time, he and other founders were unsure about featuring a rap show, believing the genre would be short lived.\n\nRival MTV’s “Yo! MTV Raps,” however, showed that hip-hop had staying power.\n\n“After kind of a brief initial hesitancy, the founders of BET really understood how hip-hop was transforming culture overall and specifically Black entertainment,” said Scott M. Mills, BET’s president and CEO.\n\n“They rapidly embraced hip-hop as part of the mission of BET,” he said. “You went from BET having shows with no hip-hop artists or music to artists and music starting to trickle through shows to this full evolution of creating dedicated shows, celebrating hip-hop music, artists and culture.”\n\nBET’s decision to embrace hip-hop literally paid off: Johnson and his then-wife, Sheila, sold the network to Viacom in 2000 for $3 billion — which made them the nation’s first Black billionaires. He remained CEO until 2006.\n\nAfter the sale, BET continued to beef up its content with reality shows and the network’s flagship program “106 & Park,” a weekday show that started in 2000 and lasted for more than a decade. The show thrived with a video countdown, interviews and performances. A year later, the network started the BET Awards then the BET Hip-Hop Awards.\n\nFor Lil Jon, he certainly benefitted from appearing on “106 & Park.” One day, the rapper-producer joined the show’s audience during the time when he had a hard time getting music on BET.\n\nLil Jon had no clue “106 & Park” co-host A.J. Calloway would notice him sitting in the crowd before he shouted out his name. The exposure helped him become more recognizable, particularly to the BET brass — who he says initially struggled to grasp the concept of his crunk music, which eventually gained mainstream appeal.\n\n“We strived to be on ‘Rap City.’ We strived to be on ‘106 & Park,’” Lil Jon said. “A.J. knew who I was, because he would go to the South and host things. He knew the power of my music. … They would show me in the audience throughout the whole show. It was what they call an impression in the advertising world. It was a way for me to be around people at BET. They started to see and get familiar with me, and they wanted to look out for me. BET was just a place where we would get support from our community.”\n\nLike Lil Jon, other hip-hop artists took advantage of the exposure from BET — which often highlighted positive images of Black people through shows such as “Teen Summit” and “106 & Park.” But in the early-2000s, the network started to take an odd turn as several popular figures — from filmmaker Spike Lee to Public Enemy’s Chuck D — heavily criticized the channel’s content for depicting African Americans in a negative light.\n\nMany took aim at the now-defunct “BET: Uncut,” a late-night mature program that contained highly sexual content such as Ludacris’ “Booty Poppin” music video. The tipping point came after Nelly’s “Tip Drill” video featured women simulating sex acts with themselves while men grabbed their bodies.\n\n“Uncut” normally finished airing early Sunday just hours before the network’s faith-based programs began.\n\nAt the time, Big Boi of Outkast was taken aback by some of the raunchy content, calling it “distasteful” and “soft porn.” Other political figures and activists showed their displeasure. Co-founder Sheila Johnson even said in a 2010 interview that she was ashamed of BET, suggesting that no one, including her own children, should watch the channel.\n\nAfter the backlash, BET took a new approach. The company researched what their viewers wanted to see and created a lineup of more family-oriented shows such as “Reed Between the Lines” and “Let’s Stay Together.”\n\n“If you look at it, hip-hop is like a huge family,” said Roxanne Shante. “You’re going to have family members that do things that’s necessarily not my thing.”\n\n“But who am I to criticize what they go through? It’s a form of expression,” said the “Roxanne’s Revenge” rapper. “I think BET has shown its ability to go with that form of expression. Now, people are expressing themselves in a different way. And now, they cater to a different audience and started to show different programming.”\n\nDespite controversy, Mills said a symbolic relationship was kept between BET and the hip-hop community. He said the network has a chance to break new artists through the BET Hip-Hop Awards while showcasing the more popular ones at the BET Awards. He shouted out veteran rapper and Oscar-nominated actor Queen Latifah, who recently hosted the NAACP Image Awards this year.\n\n“When you look at artists today, they’re profoundly talented,” he said. “The evolution of people deciding how they want to show up to the world is something that ultimately, I think we have to embrace. One thing about hip-hop, it’s always changing. We’re in the moment today, and that moment will evolve to whatever comes next.”\n\nMills said BET is exploring ways to bring back “106 & Park” as a possible residency live show.\n\nWith a new buyer looking to purchase BET soon, the network’s future focus and how much it emphasizes hip-hop will be closely watched.\n\nRapper Too Short said BET should continue to serve the Black community’s needs.\n\n“’Teen Summit’ was the best show ever,” he said. “Just for kids to sit there and have an intellectual conversation every Saturday morning. That was amazing to see Black kids thinking intelligently and debating with each other and an audience tapping in.\n\n“I don’t know why anybody doesn’t think that kind of programming is needed right now. I think BET just needs to be the community. Don’t show me an aspect. The whole thing. Be Black entertainment.”\n  ",

      "title": "In ‘Every Body,’ a galvanizing moment — and celebration — for the intersex community",
      "image": "",
      "description": "The film, which Focus Features will release in 250 nationwide theaters on June 30, shines a warm spotlight on a much-misunderstood community, and three of its most dauntless champions. NEW YORK: Like some 260,000 Americans, Sean Saifa Wall was born with significant intersex traits. The sex on the birth certificate was checked “ambiguous” and then crossed out.\n\nWall was instead labeled female on the document and, at the age of 13, after his mother was inaccurately warned of a cancerous threat, his testes were removed. Doctors told his parents to raise him as a girl, though Wall later developed masculine features and now identifies as a man.\n\n“They literally stopped my development — I was starting to develop as male. And they stopped it right there and changed course. It was a hard left,” says Wall. “It was disappointing and almost devastating that what I wanted could never be achieved. I wanted to pass. I wanted to be read as cis.”\n\n“I had to tap into something else because it was hard being misgendered all the time and people not seeing me the way I saw myself,” Wall adds. “That’s when I was like: I need to really fight back.”\n\nWall, co-founder of the Intersex Justice Project, is one of three intersex activists profiled in the new documentary “Every Body,” by “RBG” filmmaker Julie Cohen. The film, which Focus Features will release in 250 nationwide theaters on June 30, shines a warm spotlight on a much-misunderstood community, and three of its most dauntless champions.\n\nAn estimated 1.7% of the U.S. population — or about the same number of red-haired people — have some intersex traits, including genitalia, reproductive organs, chromosomes and/or hormone levels that don’t fit typical definitions for males or females. At a time when gender is an increasingly fraught battleground everywhere from state legislatures to youth sports leagues, those born intersex contradict any strictly binary notion of gender.\n\n“At the core, people are afraid of uncertainty. The thing that trans people and intersex people represent is that gray space,” says actor and filmmaker River Gallo, another subject of the film. “It’s been six years since I came out. I’m still trying to grapple with what it means to exist in between.”\n\n“Every Body,” which recently premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, seeks to be a galvanizing moment in the intersex rights movement, a small but growing advocacy for a sizeable segment of LGBTQIA+ people (the “I” stands for intersex).\n\nFear of social stigma has often haunted intersex people. But the advocate trio of “Every Body,” gathered for a recent interview in New York, are unashamed, unshakable and forthright about themselves and their experiences — and what they believe needs to change about how intersex children are medically treated.\n\nAlicia Roth Weigel, a political consultant and human rights commissioner for the city of Austin, Texas, was born with male (XY) chromosomes. As an infant, her gonads were removed, which she considers a castration. Years of hormone treatments followed.\n\n“I’ve found so much freedom in realizing that there are so many roles for all of us in the world,” Weigel says. “None of us have to be defined by — set gender aside, set sex aside — the rigid notions of what anyone thinks you should be. My whole thing is just: There’s no should. Just be.”\n\nThe United Nations, in a 2013 report on torture, called for an end to “genital-normalizing surgery, involuntary sterilization, unethical experimentation, medical display, ‘reparative therapies’” — procedures which the U.N. said may violate a person’s “right to physical integrity.”\n\nBut such surgeries have continued. A stalled bill in California sought to prohibit surgeries until a child is 12, in order to give them time to develop a gender identity and offer consent themselves. At the same time, several states have advanced anti-trans legislation that bans gender-affirming care for those under 18 or older.\n\n“What happened to me shouldn’t happen to anyone,” says the 44-year-old Wall, whose co-stars call the “OG” of the movement. “To me, that was the drive, and it’s still the drive. People ask me, ‘How are you doing all this work after all these years?’ And I’m like, ‘First, I’m a Capricorn.’ But I am determined to fight whoever to stop this. I will not stop until justice is upon us.”\n\nCohen was first attracted to the subject by the tragic story of David Reimer, a Canadian man who, in an infamous medical experiment overseen by physician Dr. John Money, was raised as a girl for most of his first 14 years of life. Reimer, after speaking out about what happened to him, killed himself in 2004.\n\nFor “Every Body,” Cohen wanted people who were comfortable speaking publicly about their experience. The 33-year-old Weigel, whom Cohen first approached, came out while speaking before the Texas Legislature in 2017 about a then-proposed bill regulating bathroom use for transgender Texans. She has an upcoming book titled “Inverse Cowgirl.”\n\nGallo wrote and stars in the the film “Ponyboi,” a film they expect to release later this year or early next. The Los Angeles-based Gallo, who has found Hollywood less liberal than it often presents itself, is accustomed to performing. But it takes courage.\n\n“I still get really scared every time a camera points at me or I get on a stage,” they say. “I would be better suited to a life that’s smaller. But I know that my experience is one that needs to be shouted from the rooftops because it could save people’s lives.”\n\nCohen, wanting to foster intimacy, filmed interviews with only herself in the room each subject. But while there are anguished and heart-wrenching aspects of the documentary, “Every Body” is a inspiring and celebratory testimony. It concludes with dancing.\n\n“The center of the whole film is just Saifa, Alicia and River telling their own stories and being their own amazing selves,” says Cohen.\n\n“The intersex rights movement is right in the middle of a lot of national conversations that we’re having right now as some of the country starts to look at gender in a more expansive way,” Cohen says. “But leaving aside the relevance and impact that they might have on trans rights cases and on nonbinary people, intersex people deserve their own lives. They want to be advocated for, too.”\n\nEven among LGBTQ causes, funding for intersex people is a tiny percentage. In national debates over trans rights, they can be forgotten. A bill passed by House Republicans in April that would bar transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports teams, advocates say, discriminates against intersex kids, too.\n\n“Every Body,” though, has brought together a dispersed and fledgling movement that’s coalesced largely online. At the Tribeca premiere, many intersex people flocked to the screening and even joined the film team on the red carpet.\n\n“Great films have always brought people together and we’re already seeing that happen on this one,” says Peter Kujawski, chair of Focus. The film, he added, “represents the best of what we do.”\n\nFor Weigel, Wall and Gallo, the screening was a deeply moving experience and a rare sense of togetherness. Weigel was there with guests, she says, from throughout her life, from elementary school to her professional career in Texas.\n\n“I felt a little bit vulnerable because I said some stuff that most human beings don’t need to share with the world in the way that we often need to expose ourselves,” Weigel says. “But it also felt very like freeing. Kind of like everyone from my world saw me for the first time.”\n\nIn one scene, Wall visits a Berlin art exhibit that paid tribute to him and others and featured nude photographs. At the sight of Wall’s naked body, the crowd cheered.\n\n“For Saifa, Alicia and River to see themselves as kind of works of art verses something that’s freakish and to be kept closeted and buried, I think, felt like a big moment,” Cohen says.\n\nWall wants the burst of energy prompted by “Every Body” to keep growing.\n\n“I hope that this film creates a wave of people going, ‘Wait, maybe I’m intersex?’” Wall says. “Given the number of intersex people in the world, it can’t be a handful of people in different countries holding up so many millions of people. We need more people. Whatever they do, just be out. Be like: ‘I’m intersex and that’s OK.’”\n\n\n  ",

      "title": "The Oscars best picture rules are changing. Here’s how it’ll affect contenders and movie theaters",
      "image": "",
      "description": "Starting with the 97th Academy Awards in 2025, best picture hopefuls will have to spend more time in theaters to qualify for film’s top prize. The theatrical requirements for movies vying for the Oscars top prize are getting a little tougher.\n\nStarting with the 97th Academy Awards in 2025, best picture hopefuls will have to spend more time in theaters to qualify for film’s top prize. The changes, announced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences this week, come after three years of adjusted release standards due to the pandemic.\n\nOn top of the current one week “qualifying run” in one of six U.S cities — New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, San Francisco or Miami — best picture contenders would now must also now play for an additional seven days in 10 of the top 50 U.S. markets. Additionally, there’s several other new rules about when the movies must play in theaters.\n\n“It is our hope that this expanded theatrical footprint will increase the visibility of films worldwide and encourage audiences to experience our art form in a theatrical setting,” Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Janet Yang said in a statement.\n\nIt’s part gesture to theaters still struggling from the pandemic, partly for audiences in markets outside of New York and Los Angeles who don’t always get theatrical access to best picture contenders, and partly a statement to deep pocketed streaming services that theaters remain paramount for Hollywood’s top prize.\n\nThe film academy’s leaders also say the decision was born out of many conversations with industry partners and that they feel that this “evolution benefits film artists and movie lovers alike.”\n\nBut some in the industry questioned what it really changes, who it benefits and who it might hurt.\n\nMichael O’Leary, the President and CEO of the National Association of Theater Owners, applauded the “important initiative.” In a statement, O’Leary said it “affirms that theatrical exhibition is the keystone of the industry.”\n\nFor traditional studios, from the big ones like Warner Bros., Universal and Disney, to the smaller players, like A24 and Neon, behind recent best picture winners “ Everything Everywhere All At Once ” and “Parasite,” it likely affects very little.\n\nFor streaming services, it could be a case-by-case adjustment depending on the company but not a hurdle. Amazon is already planning to release 12 to 15 movies theatrically every year, as they’ve already done with Ben Affleck’s “Air.” Apple is also set to spend $1 billion a year on movies that will land in cinemas before streaming, including Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon.”\n\nNetflix has had a bigger theatrical footprint lately too. Not only do they control two U.S. theaters — New York’s Paris Theater and Los Angeles’ American Cinematheque — but they’ve also historically given theatrical runs to their awards hopefuls. All of Netflix’s nominees since “Roma” have met the requirement. Its most recent best picture nominee, “All Quiet on the Western Front,” played in hundreds of theaters.\n\nThe new rule may weed out the possibility of a grassroots campaign on behalf of a very small film, however. Independent theaters and those willing to play independent films have become rarer and the competition is fierce for those screens in the major markets. Some of the bigger indie stalwarts are even scheduling major studio films, leaving fewer times and screens available for true independents.\n\nMuch like the diversity requirements that went into effect this year, few could think of recent best picture players that wouldn’t have met this threshold. Apple’s best picture winner “CODA” played in about 40 theaters. Even non-traditional Oscar “underdogs” like “ Drive My Car ” and “ RRR ” had substantial theatrical runs.\n\n“It’s important to consider that qualifying is merely a first step in a long process that involves robust and costly campaigning,” said Dan Berger, the president of the independent film company Oscilloscope. “I think it’s fair to say that nearly any film that doesn’t meet these parameters never stood a chance in a best picture race anyway.”\n\nBerger added: “Hopefully the result of this isn’t more robust and more costly campaigning that only serves to further divide merit based results from campaign based results.”\n\nThere are a lot of unknowns about the specifics of the expansion, including whether there will be minimum of showtimes and screens. Could companies simply rent out eight screens that will play to minimal or no crowds in densely populated areas that are relatively cheap and that are also not historically great for indie films? It’ll check the box, but will it help theaters, the films or audiences? And will it lead to an even greater year-end bottleneck of releases?\n\nQuestions also remain about how it will affect the eligibility of animated films and documentaries, which wouldn’t have to meet these requirements to qualify in their individual categories but now might have to adopt a different strategy to be in contention for best picture.\n\nOthers are more hopeful and know that the academy’s board of governors meet often to reassess rules as the landscape continues to change.\n\n“It’s about time that the academy made a move to recommit to theatrical. The Oscars were inching closer and closer to becoming the Emmys,” said one top awards strategist and academy member who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the changes. “Could they have gone further? Of course. But it’s a good faith step in the right direction.”\n  ",

      "description": "Sunday’s biggest surprise came when Quavo and Offset, the surviving members of Migos, performed “Bad and Boujee” in front of an image of Takeoff, who died in a shooting last December. LOS ANGELES: The 2023 BET Awards celebrated 50 years of hip-hop with tributes to the genre’s earliest voices, late legends, and new talent during a show packed with spectacular performances that consistently felt like a party.\n\nSunday’s biggest surprise came when Quavo and Offset, the surviving members of Migos, performed “Bad and Boujee” in front of an image of Takeoff, who died in a shooting last December.\n\n“BET, do it for Take,” the duo shouted near the beginning of their set, as their backdrop switched from the image of a space shuttle to one of Takeoff pointing in the air.\n\nThroughout the show, whether it was Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Biz Markie or Pop Smoke, performers and emcee Kid Capri paid homage to late hip-hop stars, often by quickly highlighting a taste of their best-known hits. In a show where few awards were given, Capri and BET kept the emphasis on the music.\n\nBusta Rhymes took home the night’s biggest honor, the Lifetime Achievement Award, handed to him by Swizz Beatz. The 12-time Grammy Award nominated rapper, producer, and pioneering hip-hop figure is widely regarded as one of the great MCs, with seven Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits to his name.\n\nDiddy, Janet Jackson, Chuck D, Missy Elliot, Pharrell Williams, and Mariah Carey recorded a video tribute to Rhymes.\n\n“Alright, Imma wear it on my sleeve. I do wanna cry,” Rhymes started his speech, as his eyes started to water. He talked about his six children, being kicked out from his hip-hop group Leaders of the New School, and learning how to rebuild by going into studios, sharing a cigar with whoever was in the studio, and “quickly whipping up a 16 bar verse. … By default, I pioneered the feature,” he said. “A lot of greatness from out people in our culture is by default. Because it’s just a magic we have.”\n\nAn energetic tribute to Rhymes followed — the MC teamed up with Spliff Star for “Ante Up Remix”, “Scenario,” “Look At Me Now”, “I Know What You Want”, before a long list of A-listers jumped in: Scar Lip with “This Is New York”, Coi Leray with “Players,” BIA with “Beach Ball,” among them. Halfway through the performance, Rhymes shifted gears to celebrate dancehall alongside Dexta Daps “Shabba Madda Pot,” Spice, “So Mi Like It,” Skillibeng, “Whap Whap”, and CuttyRanks’ “A Who Seh Me Dun (Wait Deh Man).”\n\nThroughout the show, old school hip-hop heroes and modern stars mixed it up onstage, performing tracks celebrating rap’s most influential cities and innovation. For Miami, Trick Daddy and Trina rocked through “Nann” and Uncle Luke took on “I Wanna Rock (Doo Doo Brown).” For Atlanta, Jeezy ripped through “They Know”, T.I. hit “24’s,” and Master P did “No Limit Soldiers” into “Make ’Em Say Ugh.” And for hip-hop’s reggae influence, Jamaica’s Doug E. Fresh and Lil ’Vicious did an acapella version of “Freaks,” Mad Lion performed “Take It Easy,” and PATRA nailed “Romantic Call.”\n\nCapri spun some of Tupac’s “Hail Marry” to tease a crash course on West Coast rap: Warren G’s “Regulate,” Yo-Yo’s “You Can’t Play With My Yo-Yo,” Tyga’s “Rack City”, and E-40’s “Tell Me When To Go.”\n\nAn ode to trap started with Capri spinning the late Pop Smoke’s “Dior”, before Chief Keef nailed “Faneto” and Ying Yang Twins did “Wait (The Whisper Song.”)\n\nAudience members, danced, sang along (and a few hopped up on stage) while Capri and MC Lyte keep the hostless show moving. It was a mostly hiccup-free show — save for a hitch during Patti LaBelle’s performance and the show running nearly four hours — particularly noteworthy for an event scheduled in the midst of the ongoing Hollywood writers’ strike.\n\nLaBelle honored the Tina Turner with a performance of the late singer’s hit “The Best,” telling the audience at one point she couldn’t see the words. “I’m trying, y’all!” she said before powering into the chorus.\n\nA masked Lil Uzi Vert opened the show at Los Angeles’ Microsoft Theater before it jumped into a quick history lesson. Capri walked the audience through a medley of the earliest days of New York City ’80s rap culture featuring The Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight,” MC LYTE’s “Cha Cha Cha”, D-NICE’s “Call ME D-Nice” and Big Daddy Kane’s “Raw,” into a partial cover of “Just A Friend,” an homage to the late great Biz Markie.\n\n“I would not be in this business on the stage tonight if it wasn’t for one person,” Big Daddy Kane said introducing the song. “Rest in peace.” He invited audience members to sing along to the song’s infectious chorus.\n\nALSO READ | BET Awards: Stars use stage to strongly criticize Roe v. Wade ruling\n\nThe coveted best new artist award went to Coco Jones, in a category that featured only female performers.\n\n“For all of my black girls, we do have to fight a little harder to get what we deserve,” she said in her acceptance speech. “But don’t stop fighting even when it doesn’t make sense. And you’re not sure how you’re going to get out of those circumstances. Keep pushing because we are deserving of great things.”\n\nIt was followed by a supermarket-themed performance of AP’s pick for club song of the summer, Latto’s “Put It On Da Floor Again,” sans featured artist Cardi B but no less catchy. It ended with a text tribute: “RIP Shawty Lo,” a screen read.\n\nTeyana “Spike Tey” Taylor won video director of the year, which was accepted by her mom Nikki Taylor – like a true matriarch, she interrupted the show to videocall her daughter and let her have the moment.\n\nAt the end of his acceptance speech, Rhymes urged the hip-hop community to “stop this narrative that we don’t love each other,” urging veteran musicians and newcomers alike to embrace one another.\n\nIt was the perfect mirror for the night: New York rapper Ice Spice ran through abridged versions of “Munch (Feelin’ U),” “Princess Diana” and “In Ha Mood”; Glorilla brought “Lick Or Sum” to the BET stage, and Kali powered through her TikTok hit, “Area Codes.”\n\nIn the audience, generations of hip-hop heavy-hitters cheered.

      "description": "The first track from Rodrigo’s second album, “GUTS”, “vampire,” will be released on Friday, June 30. LOS ANGELES: Buckle up for a sad girl fall. Olivia Rodrigo — the Grammy-winner best known for her 2021 smash single “drivers license” — will release her highly-anticipated sophomore album in September.\n\nThe singer-actor is reteaming with her close collaborator Dan Nigro for “GUTS,” which will be released Sept. 8, Geffen Records announced Tuesday. “SOUR,” her first album, was a multiplatinum debut that won Rodrigo three Grammy Awards.\n\n“For me, this album is about growing pains and trying to figure out who I am at this point in my life,” Rodrigo said in a press release. “I feel like I grew 10 years between the ages of 18 and 20—it was such an intense period of awkwardness and change. I think that’s all just a natural part of growth, and hopefully the album reflects that.”\n\nThe first track from Rodrigo’s second album, “GUTS”, “vampire,” will be released on Friday, June 30.\n\nIn January 2021, Rodrigo released “drivers license”, a pop power ballad that took the world by storm, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 100, where it stayed for eight weeks. The song became the first in history to hit 80 million streams in seven days on Spotify, and even earned her a viral “Saturday Night Live” parody sketch starring Bridgerton actor Regé-Jean Page.\n\nShe was nominated for seven Grammy Awards — including nominations in all four of the major categories, becoming the first Filipina to do so — and took home three, including best new artist, best pop vocal album and best pop solo performance for “drivers license.”\n\nNigro, formerly of the band As Tall As Lions, has produced records with stars like Carly Rae Jepsen and Sky Ferreira.

      "image": "",
      "description": "In this weekly column, the writer introduces you to powerful cinema from across the world It doesn’t take long for Ken Loach to underline the fact that the two warring factions we witness at the very start of his new film The Old Oak are two sides of the same coin. On one end, we have the residents of a down-and-out, unnamed village in the northeastern UK and on the other end, we have the Syrian refugees given shelter in the unoccupied homes in the village.\n\nThe mining village had seen more prosperous times till the colliery accidents, strikes, and administrative apathy towards the workers gradually reduced it to a ghost town. Ignored and unaccounted for, its people are angry and frustrated at their present condition while being hopeless and cynical of their future. The tired and frightened Syrians, fleeing the war and violence at home, are trying to build a new home from scratch in a country and culture that’s alien to them. However, even while the villagers and the Syrian refugees express their inner struggles through persistent conflicts with each other, both are united in having faced enormous losses.\n\nIt’s the local pub The Old Oak, the only community space left, that becomes a site for their traumas—personal as well as collective—to find a release. Its present-day shabby glory and the precariously dangling letter K on the signboard are symbolic of the perilous state of the town and the many insecurities in the lives of its people. It represents a way of life that is gone forever, a place lost to over 30 years of steady neglect. The disintegration of the outer world and the sense of inner desperation and despair of its people, go hand in hand. Loach is sympathetic as he goes about explaining the socio-economic-political realities with a documentarian’s attention to detail and an activist’s zeal for change. He doesn’t turn the xenophobic locals into outright villains even when they complain about their village becoming a “dumping ground” for “parasites”. He sees a possibility of reform.\n\nThe filmmaker understands that it’s hatred borne out of fear for one’s own well-being than any real anger against the other. Instead, Loach’s reproach and indictment are targeted at the government. He is optimistic when it comes to people themselves. The pub owner’s (Dave Turner) friendship with young Yara (Ebla Mari), a passionate photographer, holds the promise of healing and restoration. Like them, the two communities might come together someday and forge strong ties. The backroom of the pub, locked for twenty years, becomes a place to cook and share free community meals. As someone from the group chimes, “Sometimes in life, there is no need for words, only food”. Loach sees individuals as the ones with the power and confidence to turn things around with unity, compassion and community spirit. Too idealistic? Misplaced? Perhaps.\n\nThe Old Oak does get lumbering, didactic and a bit too on the nose with its messaging. The simplistic, naive finale tugs at the heartstrings and plays with the audience’s emotions in a cringingly obvious manner. However, strangely it leaves you utterly affected even when you are fully aware of your feelings being manipulated.  \n\n86-year-old Loach’s 14th film to feature In Competition at Cannes Film Festival might be one of his lesser works but that less is still a lot more than what we usually see most at the cinemas. Supposedly his last film, The Old Oak is a fitting final call for solidarity from a filmmaker who has stood steadily with the poor, downtrodden and deprived all through with his remarkable body of work. \n\nFilm: The Old Oak ",

      "description": "Every great spy movie needs a great villain. And, in Esai Morales’ mysterious character Gabriel, Cruise and McQuarrie feel they’ve found perhaps the most compelling and complex villain. Tom Cruise is all set to dazzle the silver screen again with his next massive outing, Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One.\n\nEvery great spy movie needs a great villain. And, in Esai Morales’ mysterious character Gabriel, Cruise and McQuarrie feel they’ve found perhaps the most compelling and complex villain in the entire Mission series. Fixated on finding a key—in two parts —that will give the holder control over an all-powerful weapon, Gabriel is an enigma, deriving pleasure from the suffering he causes; he is a ghost from Ethan’s past—before the latter joined the IMF—and a messenger with a dark vision for humanity’s future. Without Gabriel, Ethan might never have become the man he is. And without Ethan to stop him, Gabriel will bring his gift of suffering to everyone on Earth.\n\n“Gabriel is a character from deep in Ethan’s past. From before Ethan was the Ethan Hunt we know,” teases McQuarrie. “They know each other from long, long ago and have this shared event in their past that made them who they are. And now that has come full circle.” McQuarrie adds, “It’s fascinating to watch these two characters [Ethan and Gabriel] chase each other all over the planet”—especially given the conflict between them is also “distinctly personal, intimate and intense.”\n\nMoreover, Gabriel is a proxy for something even more horrifying, a menace McQuarrie describes as “far and away the biggest and most undefeatable threat that Ethan has ever faced.” “It’s been a long time, friend,” Gabriel tells Ethan when they reconnect. “You have no idea the power I represent. It knows your story… And how it ends.”\n\nMaking his film debut in Rick Rosenthal’s Bad Boys starring Sean Penn, Morales is no stranger to acting opposite powerhouse performers, having also starred with the likes of Al Pacino in Oscar Wilde’s Salome, on Broadway; and Raul Julia, in Joe Papp’s production of The Tempest. Most recently, he appeared as one of the antagonists in the acclaimed Netflix series Ozark. But, in Cruise, he has found a sparring partner that has sent the sparks flying.\n\n“I think Tom and I have the same level of energy. He has applied his energy a lot more productively than I have in my life,” Morales laughs, “but, man, I just love going toe to toe with him.” What makes Gabriel so intimidating a foe, Morales says, is a combination of the philosophical threat he poses and the lengths he is prepared to go to in pursuit of it. “It’s about fate. Everyone has their fate. Can you change yours?” Morales says of Gabriel’s motivation.\n\n“He’s a formidable character because he has no fear. There’s nothing scarier than someone who is not afraid of anything you can do to them, including killing them. I see him as an agent of change who has given his complete being to the trust that technology is superior to Man.” A Paramount Pictures and Skydance Presentation and a Tom Cruise production, Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One hit theatres India-wide on July 12 in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. \n\nOfficial synopsis:\n\nIn Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team embark on their most dangerous mission yet: To track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands. With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, and dark forces from Ethan’s past closing in, a deadly race around the globe begins. Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission—not even the lives of those he cares about most. ",

      "description": "The album slides smoothly between dreampop, ‘70s-infused folk rock and a half dozen other genres to fit comfortably into an emergent London sound... “In the End it Always Does” by The Japanese House (Dirty Hit)\n\nMore than four years have passed since the first studio release by Amber Bain, known professionally as The Japanese House. Her second album, “In the End it Always Does,” was conceived in a burst of creativity after the disintegration of a relationship. The result is a sweetly melancholic chronicle of a cycle of falling in and out of love, and a celebration of the dog who got her through it.\n\nThe album slides smoothly between dreampop, ‘70s-infused folk rock and a half dozen other genres to fit comfortably into an emergent London sound alongside artists such as Arlo Parks and Etta Marcus. Bain produces and writes or co-writes all of the songs, and plays nearly all of the instruments, including bass, guitar, keyboard, piano and percussion.\n\nGeorge Daniel of The 1975 and Chloe Kraemer share production credit. The 1975’s Matty Healy adds production, vocals and guitars on some tracks, and Muna’s Katie Gavin sings on one. But this album is largely the product of Bain’s singular talent and vision, and she establishes coherent musical and emotional themes that run its full length.\n\nThe opening track, “Spot Dog,” sets the rules on Bain’s terms, blending analog instruments with intermittently heavy production and distortion. As in many of the songs, it is slow to resolve, starting with jazzy piano noodling, and adding in other instrumentals that search for and usually find their melodies.\n\n“Sad to Breathe” highlights the extent of her toolkit. It starts soft and simple but confidently layers rhythms and complex instrumentation under the chorus, “it’s sad to breathe the air when you’re not there.” Throughout the album, lyrics are consistently simple, devastating and relatable. On the following track, “Over There,” she sings “She stops by/ From time to time/ She keeps her coat on.”\n\n“Sunshine Baby” is a lovely bit of summertime sadness with bright instrumentals and wistful delivery. She sings, “I don’t know what’s right anymore/I don’t wanna fight anymore,” but finds her grounding, “Sitting by the seafront/Lying with my sunshine baby.” (Sunshine is her nickname for her dog.)\n\nThe homestretch features a trio of songs that are reminiscent of ‘70s artists such as Rickie Lee Jones and Joni Mitchell. But feather-light Auto-Tune manipulation places them squarely in the present, in an uncanny valley specific to current anxiety over what is real and what is AI.\n\nThe final track and emotional core of the album, “One for Sorrow Two for Joni Jones” again comes full circle with her most faithful companion: “No one’s ever gonna love me like this dog lying on my lap,” and it’s easy to believe that little Joni Jones is enough for now. The album closes with a soft click – maybe a door closing, maybe a stylus reaching the end of a vinyl LP – and the circle has been completed. ",

      "title": "Music Review: Lucinda Williams at 70 is still finding her muse, still making music that matters",
      "image": "",
      "description": "Williams dedicates the entire album to Bob Stinson, “a true rock ‘n’ roll heart.” At least twice on her new album, Lucinda Williams worries about whether she can still write good songs.\n\nShe sings on one cut about putting herself “where the songs will find me.” And on the closer, “Never Gonna Fade Away,” she frets about what happens when “the words don’t rhyme, and I can’t find a line, and I’m looking for a sign, and I’m running out of time.”\n\nIronically, both are good songs. And while it’s sometimes a bad sign when songwriters bemoan the need for inspiration, Williams’ muse visits her plenty on “Stories From a Rock N Roll Heart.”\n\nThe album is, as advertised by the name, a collection of hard-charging rock ‘n’ roll. It reflects her resistance to being labeled as Americana — though she could legitimately claim a spot on that genre’s Mount Rushmore.\n\nWilliams’ honesty and empathy serve her well on “Hum’s Liquor,” a tribute to Bob Stinson, one of the founding members of the seminal rock band, The Replacements, who died years ago at the age of 35. The song, which features Stinson’s younger brother and fellow Replacements founding member Tommy Stinson, demonstrates that Williams, who just turned 70, still has the chops to strike deep emotional chords.\n\nWilliams dedicates the entire album to Bob Stinson, “a true rock ‘n’ roll heart.”\n\nHer band, a mixture of her regular touring ensemble and others, sounds especially good on a tribute to Tom Petty, who died in 2017. Starting with a winding guitar riff that could have come from Petty’s own Stratocaster, “Stolen Moments” has the power to make you miss him all over again.\n\nIt’s worth noting, without making excuses, that Williams has had a rough few years. Her East Nashville home was damaged in a tornado in 2020, and later that year she suffered a minor stroke that left her unable to play the guitar. That forced her to co-write more songs, working with husband Tom Overby and others. It may also explain why these 10 songs feel more hook-based than centered around her lyrics, and why she worries if she still has it.\n\nBut the songs do find her, with a big assist from friends and bandmates. The album may not match her best work lyrically, but that’s a high bar — and it’s still good enough to add another important chapter to one of the most important musical journeys of the last half-century.\n\n“Stories From a Rock N Roll Heart” by Lucinda Williams (Highway 20 Records/Thirty Tigers) ",

      "image": "",
      "description": " Michael Keaton returns as Batman in The Flash, he tells Sally James about his old days as the DC superhero, playing both villains and heroes. As 71-year-old Michael Keaton returns as Batman in The Flash, he tells Sally James about his old days as the DC superhero, playing both villains and heroes, and a possible sequel to his iconic Beetlejuice\n\nWhat was it like to put on the Batman costume again after all these years? \nCrazy, a little emotional and weirdly familiar. It brought back a lot of memories.\n\nDid you have to get in shape for the role? \nNo. I have to say that I’m still the same measurements I was back in the day. I’m pretty happy about that (laughs). I slipped right into the suit, although this one was a little better than the first. But I’m claustrophobic, so it’s still tough to wear. I actually use that feeling of being restricted as part of the character. It’s something Tim Burton (who directed Batman and Batman Returns) and I had worked on––powerful movements, and using the stiffness for good.\n\nIs it true that you were initially apprehensive about playing Batman, when the role first came your way? \nYeah, because I wasn’t really familiar with superhero books. I didn’t know much about Batman. I remember reading Tim’s script and thinking how I couldn’t imagine anyone making it into a movie the way I saw the character. I told him and he just nodded. That’s when things got exciting. He had asked me to read the Frank Miller’s Batman comics, which I knew nothing about at the time. But it was Tim who turned the whole movie around and made it what it is. Comic book movies are huge now. They are a cultural phenomenon, but it was Tim Burton’s Batman that kicked it all off.\n\nYou’re back as Batman, you’ve done Birdman and you’re in the MCU as the Vulture. Do you have plans to star in any more superhero movies in the future?\nI don’t think about it like that. It’s not about the genre. For me, the question has always been about who’s directing, what the cast is, if the script is good and what the story is.\n\nAny chances of seeing you back in another standalone Batman movie?\nI doubt it. Tim is my pal, my co-conspirator and a true artiste. We are doing stuff together, but it’s not that.\n\nIs that Beetlejuice 2?\nYeah, it’s something Tim and I have been talking about for years. I’m excited that it’s happening. It’s going to be very much in the spirit of the first one.\n\nYou have played both heroes and villains. Do you prefer one over the other?\nI like both. They are all just jobs to me. I deliver the role, give it everything I’ve got and then move onto the next thing.\n\nHow have you avoided typecasting in your career?\nThat is something I was always worried about. \nI thought it would catch up with me eventually, which is why I always tried to do as many different things as I could in my career. \n\nYou are as much loved for being one of Hollywood’s more down-to-earth stars as you are for some of the characters you have played. How have you managed to stay that way for so long?\nI don’t know. I just try to keep myself to myself and not share too much with people. I have no interest in people knowing much about me. I’m consistent. If I want to say something about somebody, it’s almost always a good thing. I do it as much out of respect for other people as for myself.\n\nYou are a director, producer and an actor. Which role do you enjoy the most?\nI still love acting. I enjoy the process and the people. Directing is fun too. As an actor, there’s a lot of time waiting for that sweet spot that might pop up every now and then in a scene. There’s no sitting around as a director. You are working all the time, thinking and problem solving.\n\nWhat keeps you working so much, given everything you have already achieved?\nWhat can I say? I’m a workaholic. I’ve been working since I was 14 years old. I used to cut lawns for \na dollar and a quarter. \nI shovelled asphalt, have worked behind bars. I did everything I could to pay my way through acting school. \nI’ve always had a strong work ethic. I don’t want to ever stop working.\n\nFinally, you are many people’s favourite Batman, but who is your favourite?\nFavourite Batman? \nThat’s easy... me. I’m Batman! Just kidding, I think they’re all great.\n\n––Asia Features ",

      "description": "As the first major event of the “fall festival” season, Venice is an important stop for Oscar hopefuls. The Venice Film Festival is serving up one of the year’s buzzier films as its opening night selection in Luca Guadagnino’s “Challengers.” The romantic tennis drama starring Zendaya, “West Side Story’s” Mike Faist and “The Crown’s” Josh O’Connor will have its world premiere out of competition at the 80th edition of the festival in September, organizers said Thursday.\n\n“Challengers” stars Zendaya as a tennis prodigy whose past collides with her present when her husband, played by Faist, faces off against a competitor who was once his best friend and her boyfriend. A spicy and suggestive teaser trailer that debuted recently quickly became a popular meme on social media.\n\n“It’s a modern bold story of youthful energy, love and power,” Guadagnino said in a statement. “I can’t wait for the Lido audience to dance across the notes of the soundtrack of Trent (Reznor) and Atticus (Ross) at the opening night of the 80th edition of the Mostra.”\n\nThe Italian director has had several films premiere at the festival, including “Bones and All,” which won him the Silver Lion award for directing last year, as well as films like “A Bigger Splash” and “Suspiria.”\n\nAs the first major event of the “fall festival” season, Venice is an important stop for Oscar hopefuls. Last year the festival hosted the premiere of “The Whale,” which would go on to win Brendan Fraser best actor, as well as a handful of awards contenders including “Tár,” “The Banshees of Inisherin,” “All the Beauty and the Bloodshed” and best actress nominee Ana de Armas (“Blonde”).\n\nVenice Film Festival director Alberto Barbera called “Challengers” cinema in its purest form.\n\n“Luca Guadagnino is one of the few Italian directors who has always been accustomed to working with both Italian and foreign actresses and actors, getting top results from all of them each time,” Barbera said in a statement. “Guadagnino sets no limits to his creative energy in this film as he deals with topics such as love, friendship, and male rivalry, and brings to life an enthralling and affecting movie, full of irony, sensuality, and good nature.”\n\nMGM and Amazon Studios will release “Challengers” in theatres on Sept. 15.\n\nThe full lineup for the Venice Film Festival, which runs from Aug. 30 through Sept. 9, will be announced in late July.

Wembanyama said a person — he later was told it was Spears — grabbed him from behind.\n\nSpears filed a police report, alleging battery. The Las Vegas Metro Police Department said its investigation is over and “no charges will be filed against the person involved.”\n\nWembanyama is scheduled to make his NBA Summer League debut for the Spurs in Las Vegas on Friday night. The 7-foot-3 French teen was the No. 1 pick in last month’s NBA draft and is entering the league with as much acclaim as anyone since LeBron James in 2003.\n\nThe altercation happened Wednesday night; Spears said she recognized Wembanyama at another hotel earlier in the evening and when seeing him again at the Aria Resort & Casino she “decided to approach him and congratulate him on his success.”\n\nSpears said, “His security then backhanded me in the face without looking back, in front of a crowd. Nearly knocking me down and causing my glasses off my face.”\n\nSpears said in posts on Twitter and Instagram that the run-in was “super embarrassing,” and denied grabbing Wembanyama, saying she only “tapped him on the shoulder to get his attention.” She also said that she was hopeful of getting an apology from the team or the security guard who she said was involved.\n\nWembanyama had a different account of the events. He said security advised him to not stop for anyone as he walked into the restaurant, mindful that pausing could cause a stir and allow a crowd to build. He said one person was shouting “sir, sir” to him, “and that person grabbed me from behind,” he said.\n\nHe was told hours later that person was Spears. He never saw her, he said, because he never turned around. ",
