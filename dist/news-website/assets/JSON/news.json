      "description": "The latest action comes in the wake of high instances of seizures of narcotics and drugs being reported by enforcement agencies from within the country. NEW DELHI: The government has issued directives to 9 states and 2 union territories with maritime borders to secure their coastal frontiers with a new set of guidelines to curb smuggling and anti-national activities.\n\nAccording to sources, the Ministry of Home Affairs is awaiting responses and status updates, on the directive issued in March this year, from most of the states which have not only been asked to enforce stringent compliance at the ports under their control but have also been asked to increase surveillance and tighten security along their respective coastlines to curb instances on drug and arms smuggling and other illegal activities. A similar notification was last issued in 2016.\n\nThe move also assumes significance amidst the Indian Ports Bill 2022, a draft of which was released by the government in mid-2022 for suggestions, pending in the pipeline.\n\nThe Bill moves to repeal the archaic 110-year-old Act, that dates back to 1908 relating to ports, to prevent and contain pollution at ports, ensure compliance with the country’s obligation under the maritime treaties and strengthen surveillance and security.\n\nBut the draft bill which also seeks to empower and establish State Maritime Boards for effective administration, control and management of non-major ports in India has already received opposition on grounds that it would dilute states’ control over the non-major posts, currently under them. Soon after it was made public it received considerable opposition from some states including Tamil Nadu and Kerala.\n\nThe latest action comes in the wake of high instances of seizures of narcotics and drugs being reported by enforcement agencies from within the country. While the drugs are used to fund the narco-terror networks illegal arms could possibly be reaching through this route to outfits engaged in anti-national and disruptive activities.\n\nWith a coastline of around 7,517 km, India has 13 major and 205 notified minor and intermediate ports through which 70 % of its trade business happens. Though we have about 205 notified ports, there are more than 300 locations along the coastline from where fishing activities happen, an official in the MHA said.\n\n“With 2.5 lakh boats venturing out into the seas every day with an average of 10 people per boat, it has become very important to keep a strict vigil, especially in the wake of intel inputs on possible smuggling and large quantum of seizure of drugs and arms, which point to the fact that there are gaps along the coastline through which narcotics and illegal stuff is getting pushed into Indian soil.\n\nThe suspicion of MHA is backed by evidence of abandoned packets of narcotics along coastlines and seizures of huge amounts of drugs from maritime vessels in the recent past.\n\n“There are instances of mother vessels carrying narcotics consignment often anchored at high seas in the international waters and there are high possibility of exchanges happening between crew of boats venturing out in the name of fishing and returning with those illegal stuff,” says an official of the MHA.\n\nIn May this year in a special operation with the Indian Navy, the Narcotics Control Bureau recovered 2,525 kg of methamphetamine worth ₹ 25,000 crores in a boat along the coast of Kerala. The consignment originated from the Chabahar port in Iran but the source of the drugs was Pakistan.\n\nAlthough through Operation Samudragupta, launched in February 2022, more than 4,000 kg of drugs have been seized so far, an MHA official said, \"It is quite possible some consignment must have been pushed into the country through maritime borders.\n  ",

      "description": "Incidents of power failure were also reported from many parts of the city, which resulted in the nonfunctioning of signals and manning of signalised intersections by traffic personnel. NEW DELHI: Delhi witnessed record rainfall in two decades on Saturday. The capital city recorded 126.1 mm of rain between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm, the highest in a day after 133.4 mm recorded on July 10, 2003, as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\n\nThe real picture would emerge on Sunday after data is collated. There was a record 266.2 mm of rain within 24 hrs in Delhi in July, 1958. However, the first spell of heavy monsoon rain created mayhem in residential and commercial areas of Delhi on Saturday, with inundated roads and overflowing drains leading to massive waterlogging and paralysed traffic for hours.\n\nIncidents of power failure were also reported from many parts of the city, which resulted in the nonfunctioning of signals and manning of signalised intersections by traffic personnel, it said. The morning rain that continued for several hours led to water gushing into the storerooms of the city’s most popular shopping destination, Connaught Place, and led to a closure of the Minto Bridge underpass for traffic due to waterlogging.\n\nThe mess caused by the heavy rain also exposed the preparations of various civic bodies ahead of September, when six G20 Summit events, including the summit meeting, are scheduled to take place in the city. Motorists and pedestrians had a hard time navigating waterlogged roads, flyovers and footpaths, while traders faced trouble stopping the rainwater from entering their shops.\n\nThis was the season’s first heavy spell of rain. An orange alert has been sounded for more showers on Saturday. A yellow alert has been sounded for Sunday, the IMD said. The Safdarjung observatory, Delhi’s primary weather station, recorded 98.7 mm rainfall till 2.30 pm. The Ridge Observatory recorded 111.4 mm rainfall.\n\nThe Minto Bridge underpass was closed for traffic due to the incessant rains that have led to waterlogging. Heavy waterlogging was also reported from the Tilak Bridge underpass. Commuters stuck in traffic took to social media to narrate their ordeal.\n\nOne of them said the traffic was heavy on Vikas Marg, from Laxmi Nagar to ITO. The ITO area witnessed massive traffic snarls due to the waterlogging at the Tilak bridge underpass and Minto Bridge. According to the NDMC, all major drains are flowing with full discharge capacity, resulting in excess water flowing on the roads. ",

      "description": "The Economic Offences Unit cited violations of the IT Act and received multiple FIRs against these apps, urging the public to remain vigilant and avoid taking loans from unregistered platforms. PATNA: Bihar police have approached the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) seeking a ban on more than 100 gambling/gaming and loan lending apps that are allegedly engaged in money laundering and pose a threat to the financial security of the country.\n\nThe Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of Bihar police recently approached MeitY urging it to ban more than 100 such apps, Nayyar Hasnain Khan, Additional Director General (ADG) of EOU (Bihar police) told PTI on Saturday.\n\n“The decision was taken after confirming that these apps attract Section 69 of the Information Technology (IT) Act as they contain materials that are prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India. Several complaints had been received of extortion and harassment from people who had borrowed very small amounts through such loan lending apps,” Khan said.\n\nSection 69A of the IT Act empowers the government to restrict access to any online content to protect the interest of sovereignty and integrity of the nation, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states and public order.\n\nThe EOU also received several FIRs registered against these apps and people associated with them in Arwal, Phulwari Sharif (Patna), Aurangabad and Jamui recently, the ADG said.\n\n“It’s a serious offence and such digital lending, gaming and gambling apps must be banned as they pose a threat to the financial security of the country. We are keeping a strict vigil on the activities of online lending platforms. People should also remain alert about the activities of such apps. The EOU has been creating awareness among the masses about such apps and requests the public not to take any loans from unregistered or illegal loan apps available on the Internet and Playstore,” he said.\n\nExplaining the modus operandi, the ADG said, “These loan apps on the pretext of advancing loan also access or hack all information from the customers’ phone. And that might be used by the accused company to perpetrate other financial crimes. Most of the time such apps harass the customer by charging not only a high rate of interest but by failure to repay the same, harass them by sending obscene materials to their contact list.”\n\nThe Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) has already issued an advisory stating that since betting and gambling are illegal in most parts of the country, advertisements of these betting platforms, as well as their surrogates, are also illegal under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 2019, Cable TV Network Regulation Act 1995 and the IT Rules, 2021.

      "description": "Singh had through his suit sought a direction ordering them to tender an unconditional apology to him as well as the organisations for the defamatory content and has sought damages of Rs.10,00,000. A Delhi court on Friday issued a fresh summons to British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in connection with a defamation suit filed by a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader seeking an injunction on the airing of the documentary series “India: The Modi Question”.\n\nThe summons was also issued to Wikimedia Foundation, and Internet Archives through the Department of Legal Affairs.\n\nAdditional district judge Ruchika Singla of the Rohini court observed that the defendants are foreign entities and therefore, the service of summons must be effected as per guidelines issued by Delhi high court.\n\n“As the defendants are foreign entities, the service must be effected as per the guidelines issued by the Hon’ble high court....it is directed that the summons be issued afresh to the defendants on the filing of PF within seven days to be served through the Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law & Justice, Govt. of India, as per rules,” the court order said.\n\nThe court had earlier issued a summons in May. However, an objection was taken that since the defendants are foreign entities based in USA and UK, the service could be effected only as per the procedure prescribed.\n\nWhile issuing fresh summons, the court said that mere filing of vakalatnama by the lawyers shall not do away with the mandatory requirment of the service of summons on the defendant entities under the prescribed procedure, Live Law reported.\n\n“Hence, by virtue of the same, it is clear that as per the rules formulated under the Hague Convention and by the Government of India, the summons/ notices in foreign countries can be effected only through the Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India, which admittedly not been done in the present case,” the court said.\n\nThe complainant in the case is Binay Kumar Singh, a BJP functionary who pleaded for a ban in the broadcast of the documentary. Singh had through his suit sought a direction ordering them to tender an unconditional apology to him as well as the organisations for the defamatory content and has sought damages of Rs.10,00,000.\n\nThe Centre had in January 2023 imposed a ban on the documentary which deals with the communal politics of BJP particularly the 2022 post-Godhra riots in Gujarat. The ban triggered protests and special screenings of the documentary in locations including college campuses by critics of the government and opposition parties. ",

      "description": "SGPC said that implementing Uniform Civil Code is suppression on minorities. CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) (mini parliament of Sikhs) has registered strong opposition to the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) describing that it is suppression on minorities and was no longer relevant besides unnecessary in the country.\n\nSources said that in the executive committee meeting of the SGPC today it has been decided that there is no need for UCC in the country, while the constitution recognizes the principle of unity in diversity.\n\nSpeaking after the executive committee of the SGPC, it’s President Harjinder Singh Dhami said that there is an apprehension among the minorities in the country regarding the Uniform Civil Code that this code will hurt their identity, originality, and principles. On the issue of UCC, the SGPC has constituted a sub-committee of Sikh intellectuals, historians, scholars, and lawyers, which at the preliminary stage considered the UCC as suppression for the existence of minorities, their religious rites, traditions, and culture. This sub-committee includes SGPC general secretary Gurcharan Singh Grewal, senior Sikh lawyer Puran Singh Hundal, SGPC members Bhagwant Singh Sialka, Paramjit Kaur Landran, and Kiranjot Kaur, Prof Kashmir Singh, Dr Inderjit Singh Gogoani, Dr Paramveer Singh, and Dr Chamkaur Singh. He said that as per the opinion of this sub-committee, the SGPC has expressed strong opposition against the UCC.\n\nHe said that any challenge to bani bana (Gurbani and traditional Sikh attire), bol baale (words or thoughts which are sublime or supreme as well as high and true), principles, traditions, values, lifestyle, culture, independent existence and distinct entity of Sikhs can never be accepted and the Sikh Maryada (code of conduct) cannot be tested by the worldly law. Therefore, the Sikh community opposes the UCC. He also said that the 21st Law Commission had also rejected the UCC terming it as neither desirable nor feasible.\n\nAlready the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has opposed the proposed implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in the country saying it would have an adverse impact on minorities and tribal communities. Senior SAD leader Dr Daljit Singh Cheema had said the party had opposed the UCC for the country and would submit its reservations on the issue to the 22nd Law Commission as well as in Parliament.\n\nAbout the other decisions at the executive committee meeting, Dhami said that the case against Congress leader Jagdish Tytler, accused of murdering three sikhs at Pulbangash Gurdwara Sahib in Delhi in 1984, will be pursued by the SGPC. He said that the CBI has filed a chargesheet in the court against Tytler and the fees of the lawyers fighting this case will be paid by the SGPC. He said that after the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) backed down on this matter, now the SGPC has decided to pursue this case.\n\nHe said that the EC has also approved setting up a project to digitize the old handwritten holy saroops (scriptures) at Gurdwara Goindwal Sahib. He said that old handwritten holy saroops of Sri Guru Granth Sahib arriving for the last rites at Goindwal Sahib will be identified and digitized under this project. This decision has been taken from the perspective of preserving the old valuable Sikh heritage. ",

      "description": "The proposed move to fence the agricultural fields is believed to be cost-effective and will have electric fencing passing enough current to keep the stray cattle away from fields with no harm to them Lucknow: The menace of stray cattle, which was a main poll plank in 2022 assembly elections, still persists to haunt the farmers in Uttar Pradesh. After making not so successful attempts to address the issue and Lok Sabha elections round the corner, now the Uttar Pradesh government is contemplating to resort to solar-powered fencing around farms to ward off the stray animals. Similarly, with an intent to curb the rising incidents of man-animal conflicts in buffer zones around tiger reserves, the UP forest department is planning to install solar powered fence along the outer boundary of the buffer zone.\n\nThe proposed move to fence the agricultural fields is believed to be cost-effective and will have electric fencing passing enough current to keep the stray cattle away from fields with no harm to them, said a senior official. The farmers would be provided with the equipment at subsidised rates.\n\nAs per the highly-placed sources, the state government is planning to provide about 50 per cent funding for cluster-based fencing, while the rest will be borne by farmers. The proposal seems to be helpful in saving the standing crops from the stray cattle as other tools including barbed and electric wires are banned since incidents of injury to animals were reported.\n\nThe solar powered fencing will have mild power of 10-12 watt. “With the ban on other alternatives, solar-charged fencing in other states like Rajasthan has been implemented successfully. In Uttar Pradesh, the option of community fencing or cluster-based fencing, is under consideration. This will require the farmers to come together to instal solar-charged fencing,” said Additional Chief Secretary (Agriculture) Devesh Chaturvedi. It is mainly the fruit, vegetable and pulse crops that are destroyed by the stray animals and therefore the idea is to ensure that a group of farmers come together to create larger clusters to reduce the fencing cost, another department official said.\n\nOn the other, to use the same strategy to keep the wild animals away from straying into villages bordering the buffer zone of tiger reserves, trials will begin by fencing the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR) buffer zone. “Spots that have reported a number of incidents of man-animal conflict are being identified with the help of locals. These places shall be fenced first, and a review of the effort will be done in coming months,” said a senior forest department official.\n\nAs per the forest officials, the solar fence of appropriate height will deliver a ‘very light shock’ to the animal trying to cross over thus keeping them away from entering the human fiefdom.\n\nThe fencing will first be done at spots, where cases of wild animals attacking man and livestock are common. After DTR in Pilibhit, the next fencing will take place at Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary (KWS), Bahraich. ",

The discount may be provided in any or all the classes on the basis of occupancy,\" it said.\n\nThe order also said that trains having \"classes with occupancy less than 50 per cent (either end-to-end or in some specified legs/sections depending upon the sections where discount is to be provided) during the last 30 days shall be taken into consideration.\"\n\nThe fares of competitive modes of transport will be the criteria while deciding the quantum of discount, it added.\n\nThe discount can be given for the first and/or last leg of the journey and/or intermediate sections and/or end-to-end journey provided the occupancy is less than 50 per cent in that leg/section/end-to-end.\n\n\"The discount shall be implemented with immediate effect. However, no refund of fare shall be admissible for already booked passengers,\" it said.\n\nIn case of trains where flexi fare is applicable in a particular class and the occupancy is poor, the scheme can be withdrawn initially as a measure to increase the occupancy.\n\nThis scheme will not be applicable on special trains introduced as holiday or festival specials.

      "description": "In fact, June was south peninsular India’s hottest and driest month since 1901. Besides, June rainfall was 88.6 mm—the lowest since 1901. NEW DELHI: Southern peninsular India and the United Kingdom appear to be on the same page as far as climate change is concerned. Both witnessed their hottest June in recorded history. Data compiled by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts revealed that June this year was globally the hottest on record.\n\nTraditionally, the Agni Natchathiram period in Tamil Nadu was its hottest. Also called dog days, the period this year was from May 4 to May 29. Looks like climate change has pushed the dog days by a month.\n\nIn fact, June was south peninsular India’s hottest and driest month since 1901. The peninsula, a gateway to the Southwest monsoon, received record deficient rainfall in the month and had temperatures above normal.\n\nBesides, the June rainfall over the homogeneous region of the southern peninsular India was 88.6 mm—the lowest since 1901. The previous lowest was 90.7 mm in 1976. Rainfall deficiency at 45% was unprecedented for the whole peninsular region, while the deficit was 10% countrywide (See table).\n\nExcept for Tamil Nadu, June rainfall in all southern states were in the ‘Deficient’ (-59% to -20%) to the ‘Large Deficient’ (-99% to -60%) category. Kerala, where the Southwest monsoon enters the mainland, had a deficit of 60%.\n\nOther sub-divisions of the south peninsula like coastal Karnataka, Southern and Northern Karnataka, Rayalseema, Telangana, coastal Andhra Pradesh, too, had deficient precipitation.\n\nHowever, Tamil Nadu received 6% excess rainfall due to some cyclonic circulations over the state, not due to monsoon winds.\n\n\n\nMoreover, more than half of India is staring at drought-like conditions as the rainfall deficit stood at 10% at the end of June. Out of India’s 36 meteorological sub-divisions, 19 received deficient rainfall in June.\n\nExperts see it as a fallout of El Nino—the warming of the Pacific Ocean—which is getting stronger, and the emergence of the Biparjoy Cyclone coinciding with the onset of monsoon.\n\n“This year’s monsoon onset was weak or below normal due to El Nino,” said Mahesh Palawat of Skymet, a private agency providing weather-related solutions. “Though the monsoon onset was on June 8, it hadn’t activated till June 17. Also, the timing of the cyclone and the onset of monsoon were similar, which took away the monsoon’s moisture,” he added.\n\nDr Akshay Deoras, research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and Department of Meteorology, University of Reading, UK, explained that the lack of low-pressure system activity over the Bay of Bengal and other unfavourable large-scale weather conditions kept the southern peninsular region hot and dry.\n\nExperts see no scope for improvement in rainfall this monsoon. There is a high probability (around 90%) that El Nino conditions will continue until this December. Not only the southwest monsoon, even the Northeast winter rainfall, especially over Tamil Nadu, may get impacted. ",

PULWAMA: Farm fields of Pulwama district in south Kashmir have added a purple hue with a number of farmers taking up lavender cultivation to increase their income.\n\nWith rising demand due to its medicinal values and the prospect of better returns, growing lavender has become a preferred choice for many farmers in the area, around 25 kilometres from Srinagar, which is considered the most fertile belt in Kashmir.\n\n\"We first extract oil and then do the value addition of the oil. There is a huge scope in lavender cultivation,\" said Madiha Talat, a Srinagar-based agri entrepreneur.\n\nTalat said lavender farming has also opened up opportunities for overseas trade.\n\n\"We can export the oil as it is. Its export market is huge in comparison to traditional crops which we grow. So, it is more profitable than the conventional crops. Its shelf life is long, its benefits are more,\" she said.\n\nBesides, lavender leaves can be used as tea and they can be processed as oil for use in medicines and aromatherapy.\n\n\"People in foreign countries value that tea. Its oil is also used in aromatherapy which is like the world over. We use it in perfumery, cosmetics, said Talat, who has started her own brand Roohposh and uses the oil in her various skin care products. Lavender cultivation has also created job opportunities for local youth including women.\n\nSeerat Jan, a resident of Pulwama, who has been working in lavender fields for the past three years, said, \"We pick up about one quintal (100 kilogrammes) of the raw material daily. We earn about Rs 370 per day. There are about 30 to 35 women working here, and some men as well. We sustain our livelihood through this.\"\n\nFarmers also get help from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (CSIR IIM), which has set up a facility spread over 200 acres for conducting research on different types of aromatic crops.\n\n\"We conduct R&D and extension of different types of aromatic crops, and predominantly the focus is on lavender and rose,\" said Shahid Rasool, senior scientist and in charge, CSIR IIIM at Bonoora station.\n\n\"Lavender is a signature crop which is a buzzword today because of its varied uses in the industry, which includes cosmetics, toiletries, fragrances, therapeutics, etc, Rasool said, adding that the weather of Jammu and Kashmir is conducive for the crop.\n\nAlso, the lavender plant is antimicrobial, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial and even anxiolytic, and these inherent characteristics help farmers save costs.\n\n\"We do not need to use or spray agrochemicals on it for maintaining good crop, health and yields. It is an ecologically viable crop for J&K. Its essential oil sells at Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 per kilogram,\" Rasool said.\n\nThe crop requires mild summer and cold winter to thrive.\n\n\"We look up to this as a future crop because landholdings are shrinking for the farmers and natural resources are also getting limited, so considering all those aspects, the requirement of agri inputs are less in these crops, irrigation requirement is also very less, and these crops thrive in stress conditions,\" the scientist said.\n\nMore than 100 people are working at Bonoora station to maintain the fields and the quantum of the plantation material generated from here increases every year, which in turn spurs the demand for manpower.\n\n\"The food habits of the people are changing, and so is the choice of crops. Nowadays, the concept of farming is not only about the choice of food but also about how much money can be earned from these crops. Today, there is a growing consumer consciousness for the use of natural herbs to maintain good health or well-being,\" Rasool said. ",

NEW DELHI:   The Supreme Court on Friday affirmed the Madhya Pradesh High Court’s order rejecting a plea challenging Union Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia’s nomination to the Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh in a biennial election.\n\nThe plea by one Govind Singh had challenged Scindia’s nomination for allegedly concealing information about the criminal cases pending against him in the papers. It was listed before the bench of justices Hrishikesh Roy and Pankaj Mithal.\n\nThe Madhya Pradesh High Court HC on March 17, 2023, refused to direct state police to register an FIR against Scindia for allegedly concealing information regarding the cases pending against him. Petitioner Singh had averred that the minister had not disclosed particulars or information regarding the registration of FIR for him and others in 2018.\n\nA bench of Justice Dipak Kumar said, “It is true that by order dated 26.09.2018, while deciding the application filed under Section 156(3) of CrPC, a direction was given by learned special judge (MP and MLA), Bhopal, MP for registration of FIR, which does not amount to taking cognizance. In terms of Chapter XII of CrPC, simply a direction for registration of FIR does not amount to taking cognizance under Section 190 and/or Section 200 of CrPC. In this situation, mere registration of FIR does not come within the category of pending criminal case’’.\n\nThe bench also said, “Besides this, as per the provisions of Act of 1951, it is not mandatory or necessary that a candidate, who is contesting the election in question, should disclose registration of FIR. At the time of submission of the nomination form, respondent No.1 had neither any knowledge about the registration of FIR nor any notice under Section 41-A of CrPC has been issued to him. Since he has no knowledge about registration of FIR, there is no occasion for him to disclose the same.” The bench asked the petitioner to approach the police for the registration of an FIR instead of seeking directions from the HC.\n\n ",

      "description": "Countering the Congress’s criticism of conferring the Gandhi Peace Prize on the 100-year-old publishing house dealing in Sanatan religious content, LUCKNOW:   Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday sounded the poll bugle for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls from his home constituency Varanasi, accusing the previous non-BJP ruling parties in UP of having a myopic approach to policymaking while promising to safeguard the self-esteem of the poor. The PM laid the foundation stones for 29 development projects in Varanasi worth Rs 12,148 crore.\n\nEarlier in the day in Gorakhpur, the PM called the Gita Press a ‘jeevant astha’ (vivid faith) while addressing a gathering at the concluding ceremony of the centenary celebration of the publication house as the chief guest.\n\nCountering the Congress’s criticism of conferring the Gandhi Peace Prize on the 100-year-old publishing house dealing in Sanatan religious content, PM Modi said Mahatma Gandhi was “emotionally attached” to Gita Press for which he himself wrote and had even advised it to remain free of advertisements.\n\n“It (the Gita Press) has Gita in its name and it is engaged in the work on Gita (Shrimad Bhagwat Gita). Where there is Gita, there is Krishna and where there is Krishna, there is Karuna (compassion) and Karma (deeds),” said the PM.\n\nDescribing Gita Press as a “spiritual light” guiding the humanity, Modi said crores of religious texts published by the press were empowering thousands of people around the globe spiritually. In Varanasi, assuring the deprived of safeguarding their pride and honour, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that he, the son of a poor mother would never tolerate the disrespect and insult of the poor.\n\n“Modi guarantees protection and self-esteem of the poor,” said the PM while questioning the non-BJP parties’ commitment to development. “Previous governments made policies while sitting in the comfort of air-conditioned rooms without trying to understand the hardships of the poor.”\n\n“So, when those, who were running the corrupt governments prior to 2014, hear about the labharthhis (beneficiaries), they get irritated. Earlier, only a chosen few received the benefit of welfare schemes,” said the prime minister.\n\n“In nine years, we have reached out to the deprived and downtrodden, the person on the last rung of the social ladder, understood their issues, took their feedback and then framed policies to benefit them. We didn’t work for one family, or one generation, but for the future generations,” said the PM.\n\nSpeaking about the right and honest intent to work for people, the PM cited the example of how Rajdhani Express, launched 50 years ago, could be extended to just 16 routes across the nation and Shatabdi to 19 during the last 30-35 years. “But Vande Bharat Express trains already have 25 routes in just four years of its existence and further expansion was on the anvil,” said the PM.\n\nWhen the Prime Minister arrived in Varanasi from Gorakhpur, he inaugurated the Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction-Son Nagar railway line of the Dedicated Freight Corridor. The new line, which cost more than Rs 6,760 crore to build, would allow for faster and more efficient transit of commodities. He also set the groundwork for or launched a number of additional projects in Varanasi and the surrounding areas.\n\n‘Gandhi was emotionally attached to Gita Press’\nAfter Countering the Congress’s criticism of conferring the Gandhi Peace Prize on the 100-year-old publishing house dealing in Sanatan religious content, PM Modi said Mahatma Gandhi was “emotionally attached” to Gita Press for which he himself wrote and had even advised it to remain free of advertisements.

      "description": "Former J&K Chief Minister and National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah said the authorities should state who are the homeless. Allotment of land for homeless sparks row\nThe decision to allot 5 marlas of land to homeless people has sparked a row with the political parties asking the administration to come clean on who is homeless and how it is counting the number of homeless in the Union Territory. Former J&K Chief Minister and National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah said the authorities should state who are the homeless. “How is the government counting the number of homeless? Does it include those who have come to J&K a week before or have they fixed any cut-off date? Those who came to J&K after 2019 should not be included in the list,” the NC leader said.\n\nImport duty cut for US apples worries farmers \nWith the Centre reducing import duty on American apples to India by 20%, the fruit growers in Kashmir are worried and apprehend that it will hurt the domestic apple industry and they will have to incur heavy losses. According to Kashmir Valley Fruit Growers-cum-Dealers Union president Bashir Ahmed Basheer, a reduction in import duty on American apples from 70% to 50% is a matter of concern for the growers of Kashmir and other parts of the country. Now, American apples will become cheaper than the ones grown in the country and in turn, will hurt Kashmiri growers. \n\nCity-based helpline desk for tourists opened \nIn order to facilitate and ensure hassle-free journeys for tourists and yatries during their stay in the Valley, the Directorate of Tourism Kashmir has set up a dedicated helpline desk at the Tourist Reception Centre, Srinagar. The helpline numbers are 8899941010 and 8899931010. Tourists can email their grievances to helpline.kashmirtourism@gmail.com. The aim of setting up a helpline desk is to redress the grievances of tourists regarding any service instantly and reach out to them in case of any difficulty or emergency. The move to set up a helpline desk is seen as an effort by the government to ensure a smooth stay for tourists in the Valley.\n\nFayaz wani\nOur correspondent in Jammu and Kashmir\nfayazwani123@gmail.com ",

BHOPAL:  Acting on Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s directions, the administration in Sidhi district of Madhya Pradesh, has released an amount of `6.5 lakh assistance to Dashmat Rawat – the tribal man who was peed upon by a man.\n\nSenior administrative and police officials in Sidhi district met with Dashmat Rawat in Kubri village (around 600 km from Bhopal) and handed over to him Rs 6.5 lakh cheque, out of which Rs 1.5 lakh has been released for building his incomplete house.\n\nThe development happened just a day after the tribal labourer Dashmat was welcomed by the CM at the latter’s official residence in Bhopal. The CM had on Thursday washed Dashmat’s feet, gifted him a shawl and Lord Ganesha idol, before having breakfast with him. Dashmat had also joined the CM in planting a sapling in Bhopal.\n\n\n\nWhile terming Dashmat as his friend ‘Sudama,’ the CM had enquired about his family’s well-being and also talked over the phone with the tribal labourer’s wife. During the free-wheeling chat with Dashmat, the CM came to know about the tribal family’s inability to complete the construction of the house, possibly due to financial reasons in Sidhi district. The CM, while apologising to Dashmat, assured all possible help to him.

      "description": "He credited his party for creating a separate Chhattisgarh state, which according to him, understood the needs of the people better. RAIPUR:  Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched the BJP poll campaign in Chhattisgarh where Assembly elections are due in a few months, saying the state Congress government offered only a “model of bad governance and corruption.”\n\nAddressing the BJP’s ‘Vijay Sankalp Maharally’ at the Science College ground in Raipur, the PM dubbed Chhattisgarh as an ATM for the Congress party owing to which the state leaders were often given key responsibilities during the elections held in the last 3-4 years across the country. “Corruption is the biggest ideology of Congress. The people of the state are yearning for change,” he said.\n\nHe credited his party for creating a separate Chhattisgarh state, which according to him, understood the needs of the people better. He said the Centre was doing its best for the development of the state and ensuring social justice.\n\n“For a young Chhattisgarh, the next 25 years are very crucial for its growth. But the Congress’ ‘panja’ (the hand symbol) has become a major hurdle. It will snatch your rights and destroy the state,” said the PM.\n“Congress has committed a major sin as they took oath on holy Ganga water while promising to act on many things within 10 days after coming to power. But it has not acted on its promises,” he alleged.\n\nEarlier the day, the PM laid the foundation stones for and dedicated 10 projects, including an economic corridor, rail connectivity and infrastructure, worth Rs 7,500 crore. While appealing to women, half of whom are voters in Chhattisgarh, Modi recollected a promise made by Congress on liquor ban that remains unfulfilled. “Instead, the state witnessed liquor scam worth crores to an extent that even the formula on 2.5-year rotation of power for the CM’s post got eclipsed,” said the PM.

GUWAHATI: The Indian Oil Corporation Limited has merely a few takers for its \"take home two 5 kg cylinders in exchange for 14.2 kg metallic cylinder\" offer under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY).\n\nThe IndianOil’s Assam Oil Division (AOD) made the offer after observing that a large number of customers under the PMUY were not refilling their cylinders due to various reasons including non-affordability and the option of cooking using firewood.\n\nThe refill price of 5 kg cylinders is proportionate to the 14.2 kg red cylinder. In the past one year, the Indian Oil Corporation managed to push only 1 lakh 5 kg cylinders.\n\nAssam has 44.14 lakh PMUY beneficiaries and an estimated 25% of them did not go for refill. \n\nG Ramesh, Executive Director and head of IndianOil’s AOD, said the government had introduced the 5 kg cylinders after observing the difficulties a section of PMUY beneficiaries were facing with refill.\n\n“We offered the 5 kg cylinders as we thought that would be a cheaper option,” he said.\n\nSaurav Chaliha, who is IndianOil’s General Manager (HR-CSR), said people in rural Assam tend to rely more on firewood than LPG for cooking.  \n\nRaj Jyoti Das, who is IndianOil’s Deputy General Manager (LPG Sales), said the response to composite cylinders was not good.\n\n“The feedback we have received from the ground is that many such PMUY beneficiaries argue why they should take two small cylinders in exchange for a bigger one,” Das said. \n\nThe IndianOil has launched a 10 kg see-through cylinder which is covered with a composite layer of polymer-wrapped fibreglass and fitted with an HDPE outer jacket. It costs Rs 821.\n\n‘Chhotu’, a mini cooking gas cylinder of 5 kg, has been also launched especially for catering to migrant populations in urban and semi-urban areas who do not have local address proof, people with lower gas consumption and commercial establishments with limited space.\n\nAn option for the struggling PMUY beneficiaries could be “Munna”, a 2 kg cylinder, which will be launched soon. A cylinder will cost Rs 247. ",

      "description": "The municipality has established fourteen plastic collection centres spread across nine wards, where residents may actively discard their plastic waste. AHMEDABAD: Mahua municipality in Bhavnagar, Gujarat, has launched a one-of-a-kind initiative to make the town plastic-free. By dumping plastic bags, milk, and buttermilk packages, citizens can earn money and incentives. They can earn Rs 10 for every kilogramme of plastic, and Rs 23 for every kilogramme of plastic bottles. Additionally, a kilogramme of plastic can also be traded for two kilogrammes of manure.\n\nThe municipality has established fourteen plastic collection centres spread across nine wards, where residents may actively discard their plastic waste. The municipality has also developed a recycling factory with the help of private industry to recycle the gathered plastic garbage. In order to contribute to a greener and cleaner Gujarat, Rajiben Vankar, president of Sakhi Mandal, is leading a drive to rid villages of plastic garbage in conjunction with 60 other females.\n\nWomen from Kuldevi Krupa Sakhi Mandal in Bhuj taluka’s Avadhnagar village, along with others, visit residences to collect discarded plastic bags. These ladies are not only earning a living by weaving inventive goods out of plastic garbage, but they are also helping to save the environment. This movement has gained traction among other women in the region.\n\nCurrently, 60 women are involved in the initiative and are paid to collect, wash, and chop plastic. The women who pick plastic are paid Rs 15 per kilogramme. They also weave plastic trash into a variety of items such as purses, bags, wallets, and other accessories. Each lady is compensated based on her labour. Rajiben, Rajiben was recently honoured with the President’s Award in New Delhi for her services to biodegradable and plastic trash.\n\nSuch campaigns are becoming increasingly important in Gujarat for environmental protection and green growth. Similarly, Gujarat’s plastic recycling initiative in Dhoraji taluka is critical to environmental protection and green growth. It has emerged as the state’s largest plastic recycling cluster, with over 450 enterprises involved in the recycling process. These companies manufacture a diverse range of items, including ropes, box bars, pipes, and cotton, which are not only used locally but also exported to countries such as the United States, Bangladesh, and African nations.\n\nThese campaigns are making contributions by highlighting the state’s commitment to sustainable development. The state’s efforts to achieve green growth have become an encouraging model for other regions to emulate. Its green growth narrative will serve as a model for other states.\n\nRecycling factory and plastic collection centres\n\nThe municipality has developed a recycling factory with the help of private industry to recycle the gathered plastic garbage.

Similar to its allegations that the previous BJP government in Karnataka was a ‘40% commission’ administration, the Gujarat Congress has begun a campaign against the BJP in the state. Congress leader Amit Chavda questioned the quality of two bridges: one in Vyara, which collapsed, and another in Ahmedabad. “Any government tender is approved after a 40% commission is paid to ‘Kamalam’ (BJP office in Gujarat),” he said.\n\nSuspense over state BJP president post\nGujarat’s hottest talking point, perhaps more than the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections, is state  BJP president CR Patil. The three-year tenure of Patil expires in July. Under Patil’s leadership, the party has won 156 seats in assembly polls. So, the question now is whether he will be retained as the state BJP president or called to Delhi. The suspense grew when the BJP on Monday named the state presidents of four states but delayed the announcement on Gujarat.  According to sources, there is a possibility of a Union cabinet reshuffle around July 9 and therefore Patil’s next role may become clearer only after July 9.\n\n2 ministers to lose seat in cabinet expansion\nAccording to discussions in Gujarat’s political circles, two of the seven ministers from Gujarat in the Central government may be ousted in the upcoming Union cabinet expansion that is expected on July 9. They could be replaced by two new faces. Gujarat now has four cabinet-level and three state-level central ministers in the Centre, including Home Minister Amit Shah, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya and Animal Husbandry Minister Purushottam Rupala. Sources said any two of Gujarat’s Union State Ministers could be dropped in the next expansion. They include Dr. Mahendra Munjpara.\n\nDilip Singh Kshatriya\nOur correspondent in Gujarat\ndilipsingh@newindianexpress.com ",

NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the draft of the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Bill 2023, which will be tabled in the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament. According to official sources, the Central government had sought feedback from the public and received as many as 21,666 responses. The sources added that valuable suggestions were received from government agencies, private entities, members of civil society, law firms, journalists and others.“The idea was to have maximum consultation, and we have considered all suggestions seriously,” said an official.\n\nAccording to the government, the purpose of the proposed bill is to govern and safeguard the use of the personal data of citizens. It mandates that the collection and usage of personal data should be lawful, protected from breach, and have transparency. It says the collection of data should be for a legal purpose and that the data should be safely stored till the purpose is served.  \n\nIn case of a data breach, it should be reported in a fair, transparent, and equitable manner to the Data Protection Board, a Central government-appointed body. The bill also proposes exemptions. For instance, the government can collect and keep data on grounds of national security, law and order etc. If disputes arise, the Data Protection Board will decide on them. The bill will also have an alternative dispute resolution mechanism under which a complaint can be resolved by mediation or other process of dispute resolution.\n\nThe Data Protection Bill was first drafted in November 2022. Since then, it has gone through several rounds of public discussion. The bill also has the option of voluntary undertaking by the ‘guilty’ party. If the board accepts the voluntary undertaking in any matter related to non-compliance, then the party would be exonerated for its failure to comply with some provisions of the law.\n\nRs 250 crore fine for violation of norms\n\nThe draft bill proposes to levy heavy penalties up to Rs 250 crore on companies for every instance of violation of norms.

It has also been advised to launch a drive to complete the signalling wiring diagrams and also to properly adopt the standard practices for carrying out signalling modification work. The Ministry of Railways had tasked the CRS, a statutory unit of the government, with conducting an inquiry into the Balasore train mishaps that happened on June 2.\n\nThe CRS report, submitted recently to the ministry, not only stated that the Balasore accidents were due to wrong signalling but also asked the Railways to ensure that the alteration to signalling circuits be carried out in the presence of an officer. It also has recommended that a separate team be deployed for testing the modified signalling circuits.\n\n“It is also learnt that there was a similar incident of mismatch between the intended routes set by signals and the actual route taken by the train on May 16 in 2022 in the Khargapur division of the same South Eastern Railway, on account of wrong wiring and cable fault. Had the corrective measures been taken after this incident, the issue of wrong wiring addressed, the accident at Balasore would not have taken place,” the report stated.\n\nIt suggested to the Railway Board that the initial response to such a disaster should be faster. “The Railway Board should review the system of disaster response in the zonal railways, and also coordinate between the zonal railways and various disaster response forces,” the report added. It has also been suggested that provision should be made for separate logging of physical relays in the station-data logger in all zones. ",

      "description": "It was also argued that the Presidential Order of August 5 substituted the concurrence of the Governor of the sate to change the very character of a federal unit. NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court is likely to commence hearing a batch of pleas, challenging the Centre’s decision of abrogating Article 370 of the Constitution that granted special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, from August.\n\nAlthough the case has been listed before the five-judge constitution bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud, Justices SK Kaul, Sanjiv Khanna, BR Gavai and Surya Kant for July 11, the same is listed for “directions”.\n\nThe revelation regarding the commencement of the hearing was made by Justice BR Gavai while hearing a plea filed by social activist Teesta Setalvad. When senior advocate Kapil Sibal suggested hearing Setalvad’s plea in August, Justice Gavai said, “It will be too late because we will begin hearing the challenge against Article 370.”\n\nSibal said he thought it was going to begin on July 11. Clarifying, Justice Gavai said that the pleas have been listed on July 11 only for directions. “That is only for directions. Tentatively, we will be starting in August,” Justice Gavai said.\n\nThe pleas were filed in the wake of the amendments praying for declaring the Presidential Order issued under Article 370, repealing the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, and the J&K (Reorganisation) Act, 2019 as “unconstitutional”.\n\nThe petitions also challenged the Centre’s “unilateral” move unravelling the unique federal structure of India by dividing J&K “without taking consent from people”. Questioning the Centre’s move, under cover of President’s rule with the view to undermining crucial elements of due process and the rule of law, the pleas stated what happened to Jammu and Kashmir “goes to the heart of Indian federalism”.\n\nIt was also argued that the Presidential Order of August 5 substituted the concurrence of the Governor of the state to change the very character of a federal unit. The pleas were last listed on March 2, 2020, when the constitution bench had held that there was no need to refer the matter to a larger bench.\n\nThe hearing had commenced on December 10, 2019 — four months after the repeal of the Jammu and Kashmir special status — before a Constitution Bench comprising Justices N V Ramana (now retired), SK Kaul, R Subhash Reddy (now retired), B R Gavai and Surya Kant.\n\nJudges recuse from hearing river dispute\n\nSupreme Court judges Justices AS Bopanna and MM Sundresh recused from considering the case related to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka Penniyar river dispute on Wednesday. While Justice Bopanna hails from Karnataka, Justice Sundresh hails from Tamil Nadu. “This cannot be heard by us. Both of us would start fighting. He (Justice Sundresh) is saying let Pennaiyar Water Dispute Tribunal be constituted. I am saying no. All the water that goes to them is from my district. The birthplace of Cauvery is my district,”  Justice Bopanna, the presiding judge of the bench, said in a lighter vein when the matter was called for hearing. Tamil Nadu filed the suit in 2018 seeking a permanent injunction on the project. ",

In this case, financial support will be provided to biologically unrelated foster parents for nurturing the child NEW DELHI: Orphans, street children and kids in difficult situations will now be provided financial support, education, foster care and rehabilitation, said an official from the Ministry of Women and Child Development on Wednesday. The Child Welfare and Protection Committee (CWC), under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, has been tasked with identifying children in need of support, the official said.\n\nThe beneficiaries are being assisted with sponsorship, foster care and adoption under the ministry’s Mission Vatsalya Scheme, which aims to provide child protection and development aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n“Sponsorship facilities will be provided to these children recommended by the CWC and approved by the Sponsorship and Foster Care Approval Committee,” the official said, adding that “states and Union Territories will be requested to extend sponsorship facilities to the eligible children.”\n\nUnder the sponsorship programme, the children will be supported through different modes of non-institutional care, which includes two types of financial assistance, the official explained. While one will be government-aided sponsorship, the second will be private.“Financial assistance may be extended to vulnerable children living with extended families or biological relatives for supporting their educational, nutritional and health needs,” the official said.\n\nIn foster care, the child’s responsibility will be undertaken by an unrelated family. In this case, financial support will be provided to biologically unrelated foster parents for nurturing the child, the official added. Also, arrangements will be made to ensure these legally free children are adopted. “Specialised Adoption Agencies will facilitate the adoption programme,” the official said.\n\nMoreover, aftercare arrangements will also be made for these children. The children who are leaving a childcare institution on completion of 18 years of age may be provided with financial support to facilitate the child’s reintegration into society. Such support may be given to children aged between 18 and 21 years. However, this age limit can be raised up to 23 years in a bid to help the child become self-dependent, added the official.\n\nChild support\n\nFinancial assistance may be extended to vulnerable children living with extended families or biological relatives for supporting their educational, nutritional and health needs.

RAIPUR: Union home minister Amit Shah visited the Chhattisgarh capital on Wednesday late evening, two days before the scheduled trip of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, creating a buzz that the central leadership is taking over the command of BJP in the poll-bound state.\n\nOn arrival, Shah moved straight to Kushabhau Thakre Parisar, the party headquarters in the state, where he met the senior party leaders and office bearers who were asked to attend the crucial meeting. According to the BJP leaders close to the development, Shah chaired a series of closed-door meetings to chalk out a strategy to return to power. He sought feedback on the party’s accomplishments at each assembly.\n\nHe also sought views on how to step up the attack on the ruling Congress. Besides wanting to bury the reported differences among the party leaders ahead of the polls. The media was not allowed inside the party premises. Shah interacted with the state party-in-charge Om Mathur, co-in-charge Nitin Nabin, regional organisation general secretary Ajay Jamwal and the state president Arun Sao.\n\nThe Union minister scrutinised the party’s proposed plan of action with the senior leaders and the core group.

      "description": "Ajit’s present revolt is better managed this time around because most of the senior party leaders who were close aides of Sharad Pawar are now in his camp. MUMBAI: In what a day of numbers, a student showed he is better at it than his esteemed teacher. Rebel NCP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar wasn’t bluffing when he claimed the bulk of the party’s legislators were on his side, as a meeting he convened at Bandra on Wednesday was attended by 32 of the 53 party MLAs. In comparison, a parallel meeting party chief Sharad Pawar called at the Y B Chavan Centre drew just 16 MLAs. The remaining five were neutral.\n\nWhile Ajit addressed the meeting with all prominent leaders, Sharad Pawar’s gathering had new and young faces. The mood in the Pawar senior camp was nervous, while the rival camp appeared confident.\n\nAfter days of paying lip service to Sharad Pawar, the gloves were finally off as nephew Ajit asked him to retire from active politics gracefully and hand over the reins to him. “Even government officials retire at a certain age, but Uncle Sharad Pawar wants to remain at the helm of the party forever. Why?” he wondered.\nSources said Ajit aims to get 45 MLAs on his side by and by.\n\n“In the meeting, 32 MLAs came out publicly in support of Ajit Pawar. There are other fence-sitters who will take a decision at the eleventh hour. A few other MLAs who attended the meeting called by Sharad Pawar today are likely to switch sides when Ajit gets elevated as chief minister. Once the Ajit camp has the numbers, it can claim the right over the party, including its name, flag and election symbol,” said sources.\n\nAjit’s present revolt is better managed this time around because most of the senior party leaders who were close aides of Sharad Pawar are now in his camp. His previous rebellion was easily broken by his uncle as Ajit hadn’t done enough spadework, sources added.\n\nTo avoid poaching, Ajit has decided to lodge MLAs in his camp at a five-star luxury hotel in Mumbai. “Ajit has been promised by the top leadership of the BJP that he will get the CM’s post if he can muster the numbers. Once the legal process is over, the MLAs will be sent home,” sources added.\n\nTime to gracefully retire, says Ajit\n\n“You are 83, aren’t you going to stop? Everybody has his innings. The most productive years are from 25 to 75 years. Give us your blessings and we will pray that you live a long life... ‘For us, Saheb (Sharad Pawar) is a deity and we have deep respect for him. IAS officers retire at 60. Even in politics, BJP leaders retire at 75,” Ajit said\n\nDangles carrot of funds and posts\n\nAjit appears to have assured all his supporting legislators that he will allocate sufficient funds for contesting Maharashtra and the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Some of them will be inducted as ministers while others would get cushy posts like chairperson of state cooperative bodies. Sources said Ajit also promised big development funds to the MLAs on his side so that they would have something to show in their respective constituencies when they seek re-election. ",

NEW DELHI: Amid speculations of a Cabinet reshuffle, many Union ministers are spending sleepless nights, apprehensive of being dropped from their ministries at a time when only nine months are left for the 2024 general election.\n\nWith over half a dozen Union ministers visiting the party central office here in the last two days, the buzz about organisational and ministerial reshuffle is growing louder. Several Union ministers and senior leaders, including Pralhad Patel, visited the party headquarters and met BJP president JP Nadda on Wednesday. Sources said Sunil Jakhar, the newly appointed Punjab unit chief, was one of those who visited Nadda.\n\n“The continuous visits of Union ministers and some senior leaders, including former railway minister Dinesh Trivedi, might be related to the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament.  It is believed that they might have been hinted about the reshuffle,” a senior party functionary said.\n\n\n\nCivil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia too visited the party headquarters and met Nadda after being called in. On Tuesday, several Union ministers, including Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghawal, Environment and Forest Minister Bhupendra Yadav and  Union Minister Kiren Rijiju visited Nadda.\n\nAccording to sources, they discussed the party’s stand on several issues and also about the upcoming Lok Sabha election. Delhi political circles are abuzz with talks of Sitharaman contesting LS election from Madurai or any other safe seat in Tamil Nadu or another state in South India.\n\nParty sources said Bhupendra Yadav may be engaged in organisational works in the coming days. Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat may get major organisational responsibility. He had met party general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh. Another minister, S P S Baghel, also met the party president.\n\nThe saffron party remained tight-lipped on what transpired in the meetings. Sources, however, said that either the ministers would have been asked to prepare for elections leaving their ministries or they would have been briefed about the party’s stand on several issues ahead of the monsoon session of the Parliament.\n\nSpeculation is rife that Minister of State for External Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs V Muraleedharan will be made the party chief in Kerala, considering his sound organisational skills and experience. The names of Shobha Karandlaje for Karnataka, Mansukh Mandaviya for Gujarat, Ram Vilas Sharma for Haryana and Narendra Singh Tomar or Pralhad Patel for Madhya Pradesh are also doing the rounds. ",

      "description": "A senior party insider revealed that the Congress high command intends to refrain from making significant decisions regarding the Chief Minister’s position until the elections are completed. JAIPUR: Thursday could be a crucial day for Rajasthan Congress which faces a rift between CM Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge has called a meeting in Delhi to which most of the important leaders of the Rajasthan Congress, including CM Gehlot, Pilot, PCC chief GS Dotasra and state party in-charge Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa have been invited.\n\nThe final role and position to be given to Sachin Pilot could be decided in the meeting, party sources said. The buzz is that Pilot may either be made state party president or the head of the campaign committee. While the Congress leadership has repeatedly asked Pilot to come to Delhi and become the AICC general secretary, he has refused to take that offer. In contrast, the Gehlot camp has resisted all efforts to make Pilot the state party chief or a deputy CM.\n\nThe Congress wants to project unity in the state party in the run-up to the Assembly polls. Therefore, the aim of the party is to arrange a détente between the two in the tussle. It remains uncertain whether Gehlot, who recently sustained a leg injury, will be able to attend the meeting.\n\nA senior party insider revealed that the Congress high command intends to refrain from making significant decisions regarding the Chief Minister’s position until the elections are completed. The primary focus now lies on appeasing Sachin Pilot. Some experts suggest that the high command may want Pilot to be the party’s general secretary, which aligns with the Gehlot camp’s aspirations.\n\nHowever, Pilot has made it clear that he is ready to work on the ground in Rajasthan without seeking any formal position. Many contend that the high command could persuade Pilot to resume the role of Deputy Chief Minister. Yet, this proposition encounters a major obstacle as such an appointment would necessitate a significant reshuffling of the entire cabinet, a move deemed impractical merely five months before the code of conduct comes into force. Simultaneously, some experts believe that Pilot could be entrusted with the responsibility of the state party president again. However, Gehlot remains reluctant.\n\n‘Pacifying Pilot’\n\nA senior party insider said that the Congress leadership intends to refrain from making significant decisions regarding the CM’s position. The primary focus now lies on appeasing Sachin Pilot. ",

MUMBAI: The Maharashtra NCP coup is complete and comprehensive. Sworn in Deputy Chief Minister just the other day, Ajit Pawar on Wednesday hit out at Sharad Pawar, saying his uncle wants to remain the party chief because he wants his daughter Supriya Sule to be the CM. He also said he was “insulted” several times in the past on the question of siding with either Shiv Sena or BJP. The new entrant to the Shinde-Fadnavis team opened up at the Bhujbal Knowledge City at Bandra West on Wednesday.\n\n“I have been deputy CM. We could have got the chief minister’s post, but my uncle refused it,” he said.\n“I am fed up with the DCM post.

On why he did not tie up with BJP and formed the government with Shiv Sena, Pawar said Shiv Sena’s Hindutva “is inclusive and takes all castes and communities together.  “It is not like BJP’s ‘myopic Hindutva’ dividing the people on the lines of caste and religion,” he said.\n\nBut Ajit Pawar was unrelenting. “We were in talks with the BJP in 2014, 2016 and 2019. I was sent to talk with BJP; we finalized the distributions of cabinet portfolios. But his uncle changed his mind at the last moment. Due to this, I was humiliated and seen as a villain,” said Ajit.\n\n“If we can share power with Shiv Sena, then why not with the BJP?” asked Ajit. On his part, Sharad Pawar said the Ajit faction has criticized him but has retained Sr Pawar’s posters and banners.“They know they have no worth in the political market and will not fetch the votes. Therefore, they want to use my photograph. But people are shrewd enough to understand these things,” said senior Pawar. ",

NEW DELHI: A new national survey shows that over half of the city, its dwellers suffer due to water logging on streets. Citizens end up wasting time, energy and productivity.\n\nThe waterlogging on streets leads to loss of working hours, damage of assets, increased traffic time and accidents. The survey also reveals that urban landscapes, consisting of all tiers of cities across the country, face a greater magnitude of problems of waterlogging and flooding. \n\nIt is a typical scene of waterlogging in major cities after a spell of heavy downpours. Videos of heavy downpours and water logging keep floating all across social media platforms. But the waterlogging and flooding of urban landscapes is beyond the major cities. It is a feature of almost every tiered city.\n\nThe survey, conducted by India’s leading Community Social Media platform, LocalCircles, showed that around 94 per cent citizens surveyed indicated that their city or districts get waterlogged during the monsoon season. \n \nThe community platform survey received over 22,000 responses from citizens located in 293 districts of India. The respondents consist of over two-thirds of men and the rest were women. However, around half of the respondents are from Tier-1 cities followed by, one-third from Tier-2 cities and the rest of them are followed by Tier-3&4 cities.  \n \nThe expert cited reasons for waterlogging and flooding in urban landscapes are; increasing built-up areas, failure to make provision to collect runoff or let the soil absorb it, lack of stormwater management, and clogged drainages.\n \nThe most significant segment of the problem city dwellers face due to waterlogging is spending more time in traffic, followed by vehicle wear and tear-related costs, risk of accidents and loss of working hours.\n \nAccording to survey data, 84% of respondents indicated that waterlogging results in their having to spend “much more time in traffic”; 68% indicated that it leads to “vehicle wear and tear and related costs”; 68% stated that it raises “risk of accidents”; 54% of respondents stated that it leads to “losing working hours/ productivity”.\n \nIt is not just the private vehicles that get damaged but also public property when buses get partially or fully submerged in water and road infrastructure damage.\n  ",

The pleas will be heard on July 11.\n\nNoting that a five-judge Constitution bench has listed for July 11 the hearing of petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370, the bench comprising Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, and Justices PS Narasimha and Manoj Mishra, posted the pleas for the same day. “We will adjourn this. The 370 matter is listed for directions on July 11,” the bench said, refusing to issue a notice.\n\nThe pleas filed by the National Panthers Party leaders Manju Singh and Harsh Dev Singh had sought directions to the Election Commission of India to hold the elections in the Union Territory without further delay. It was argued in the plea that delaying elections has resulted in the people of Jammu and Kashmir being denied their right to have elected representatives. \n\n“People of J&K, including the petitioners, have been deprived of their right to be represented by elected representatives in violation of the fundamental tenets of democracy, which the SC had held as part of the basic structure of the Constitution in ‘Keshavananda Bharti V/s Union of India & Ors.

While coming out of a recent BJP meeting at Sawai Madhopur, he was asked about the Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP) which is crucial for providing water to 14 districts in the state but is getting delayed due to lack of Centre’s support. In response, taking the name of Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore, Shekhawat remarked, “Make Rajendra ji’s rule, I will also give the Rs 46,000 crore needed for ERCP project.” This has given rise to talk that Shekhawat has declared Rathore as the BJP’s face for CM in Rajasthan. \n\nDelhi summons Raje and gives grist to the rumour mill\nThe sudden cancellation of former CM Vasundhara Raje’s trip to Kota on Thursday led to much speculation. Party insiders say the Central leadership suddenly called her to Delhi for a meeting. Several leaders, including former MLA from Kota North and pro-Vasundhara MLA Prahlad Gunjal held a big rally in Kota on July 2.\n\nThis rally, incidentally, got no support from the BJP and even state president CP Joshi did not speak about it. Now, the question is whether Raje was called to Delhi for a dressing down from top brass or to be given a new role in view of the forthcoming elections.\n\nGovt aid for organ  transplant patients\nThe Ashok Gehlot government has come up with patient-friendly guidelines under the Chiranjeevi Health Scheme for those needing organ transplants. Under these, patients can get organ transplants done for free at any hospital even outside Rajasthan.\n\nIn addition, patients and one attendant will be reimbursed upto Rs 1 lakh for air tickets in case they need to travel outside the state for organ transplant or cochlear implants. In special cases, 50% of all expenses will be paid as advance for serious patients needing organ transplants. This is likely to be a huge relief for countless families in Rajasthan who are in need of transplants. ",

There is no truth in it.” NEW DELHI:  The high-decibel political drama being played out in Maharashtra politics shifted to Delhi on Thursday with the working committee of the Nationalist Congress Party headed by Sharad Pawar expelling Praful Patel, Sunil Tatkare, and nine other MLAs who switched sides to join the Sena-BJP government in Maharashtra.\n\nThe move came a day after Maharashtra deputy CM and NCP leader Ajit Pawar removed Sharad Pawar as president of the party, which he founded more than two decades ago. After chairing a crucial national executive meeting in New Delhi, Sharad Pawar asserted he is still the president of his party. “I am the president of NCP.\n\nWe will rebuild the party,” he said. Dismissing Ajit Pawar’s claim of being the real NCP president, Pawar said: “Anyone can say anything. There is no truth in it.” Responding to his nephew’s comments about his age, the veteran leader said, “I am still effective, whether I am 82 or 92.”\n\nEarlier this week, Ajit Pawar took a swipe at senior Pawar, urging him to step down and make way for new generation leaders. Addressing the media after the working committee meeting, party leader P C Chacko said all 27 state committees of the party are in support of Sharad Pawar.\n\nEight resolutions were passed in the meeting to ratify the expulsion of the nine rebel MLAs who took oath as ministers in the Shinde government. Sharad Pawar also sought to play down Ajit Pawar’s remarks that the meeting called by him has no legal sanctity as the dispute on who represents the real NCP is within the jurisdiction of the ECI.\n\nThe veteran leader said: “The meeting was called as per the party’s Constitution.” He also expressed faith in the Election Commission. “We have faith in the EC. We are clear about the legal position,” he said. According to sources, Sharad Pawar has sent a letter to the EC, questioning why he was kept in the dark about Ajit Pawar’s staking claim for the party symbol.\n\nSharad Pawar also dismissed suggestions that the NCP had diminished in strength after the rebellion.

NEW DELHI: The Indian government will be on tenterhooks on July 8, the day Khalistani supporters have called for rallies across Canada, US, UK and Australia. It is not just the rallies that are of concern to the government, but also the photographs of Indian diplomats that have been displayed as potential targets.\nIndia has been particularly concerned about the incidents that have been allowed to happen in Canada – from vandalising the consulates to taking out tableaus hailing the assassination of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The threat to Indian diplomats and the rally dates on posters first appeared in Canada and followed all over.\n\n“Posters inciting violence against our diplomats are unacceptable,’’ said Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi on Thursday. External Affairs Minister, Dr Jaishankar, too has oft repeated that vote bank politics is one of the possible reasons for Canada to permit such things to take place in their soil.\n\nMeanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday was on the defensive. “We have always taken serious action against terrorism and we always will. We have an extremely diverse country and freedom of expression is something we have. We always make sure we are pushing back against violence and extremism in all forms,’’ Trudeau said.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly assured that they would do everything to protect the Indian High Commission in London. “Any direct attacks on the Indian High Commission in London are completely unacceptable. We have made it clear to India’s High Commissioner to London, Vikram Doraiswami, and the Government of India that the safety of the staff at the High Commission is paramount,’’ said Cleverly. Britain is not taking any chances after the Indian flag was brought down at the Indian High Commission in London earlier.\n\nIn the US, where the Indian consulate at San Francisco was attempted to be burnt, the US government was quick to react and oppose it.\n\n“The US strongly condemns the reported vandalism and attempted arson against the Indian consulate in San Francisco on Saturday. Vandalism or violence against diplomatic facilities or foreign diplomats in the US is a criminal offence,” said US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.\n\nIndia has been assured of support in Australia too. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has assured India of strict action against Khalistanis. Under the Geneva Convention, all diplomatic missions and their staff have to be taken care of by the host country. India is optimistic the Khalistani supporters are reigned in and do not resort to violence. ",

SAD has also ruled out the possibility of an alliance with the BJP. CHANDIGARH: Amid a reunion buzz involving the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the BJP ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the saffron party’s Punjab in-charge Vijay Rupani on Thursday said his party would fight the parliamentary elections on its own, without an alliance. SAD has also ruled out the possibility of an alliance with the BJP.\n\nSAD, in alliance with Mayawati’s BSP, fought the 2022 Assembly polls and ended up frustratingly at number three after AAP and Congress. The BJP and SAD ended their three-decade-old alliance in 2020 in the wake of farm laws that were later junked.\n\nPunjab BJP in-charge Vijay Rupani was in Amritsar on Thursday to pay obeisance at Golden Temple along with new Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar. “The BJP in Punjab will fight the 2024 Lok Sabha elections on its own without forming an alliance with any other party. We will contest the elections alone in the state and win all 13 Lok Sabha seats. The party will contest the parliamentary elections under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi and form the next government at the Centre,” Rupani said.\n\nAsked about the speculation that his party could have an alliance with SAD yet again, he said, “I have already said that we will contest alone. It is up to you to interpret my statement.”\n\nNewly appointed Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar said the party leadership would take a call on any alliance as he would seek feedback from BJP workers if any realignment was acceptable to them.\n\nMeanwhile, SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal met senior leaders of his party at his residence in Chandigarh on Wednesday where he was advised to be cautious and examine all aspects before taking any decision. “We must also keep in mind the impact of any decision we make on all Punjabis, especially Sikhs,” said a senior SAD leader.\n\nSources said SAD leaders asked Sukhbir to seek clarity from the BJP on the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) and its impact on the rights of minorities, especially the Sikhs. He should also demand the release of Sikh detainees lodged in various jails in the country.\n\nHowever, SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said that there was no question of an alliance with the BJP as the BSP is the SAD ally. \n\nSAD spokesperson Daljeet Singh Cheema said, “There is no discussion on our alliance with the BJP. Our alliance with the BSP is intact.”\n\nOn the other hand, the BSP seemed to be in a dilemma. BSP’s Punjab chief Jasvir Garhi said he has been enquiring about the reports of a possible SAD-BJP alliance from the senior SAD leadership, but they all have been feigning ignorance.\n\nSAD lost the 2017 and 2022 assembly elections. Currently, the party has only three MLAs in the assembly, while the BJP has two legislators. Both parties were in alliance for more than three decades. The SAD had walked out of the NDA in September 2020 following the farmers’ protests against three Central controversial farm laws, which were later repealed. The three laws had led to a huge protest in Punjab. ",

They reiterated that there can be no justification for violent extremism and radicalization in a democracy.\n\nIt may be recalled that Khalistani supporters had brought down the Indian flag at the Indian High Commission on March 20. British authorities have assured India of doing whatever it takes to rein in these extremist elements. Khalistani supporters have called for a rally on July 8 and have added pictures of Indian diplomats in posters about the event, threatening to harm them.\n\nAlso, this meeting comes after the mysterious death of Avtar Singh Kanda, UK chief of the Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), on June 15 in Birmingham.

It was also agreed to deepen collaboration in critical and emerging technologies.\n\nBarrow is likely to meet other dignitaries during his ongoing visit. ",

A group of 88 academicians has demanded to reinstate Professor Tejaswini Desai, who was forced to go on leave last month for saying that rapists could belong to any religion.\n\nAs per media reports, on June 8, the 52-year-old physics professor at the Kolhapur Institute of Technology’s College of Engineering had a discussion on religious discrimination in her class where some students had accused Muslims of “being rapists and never getting punished for their crimes.”\n\n“Some students said Hindus never engaged in riots and Babri Masjid was demolished on the orders of the Supreme Court,” the prof told Newslaundry.\n\nIn response, Tejaswini Desai told the class that rape was not limited to any particular religion or community. “Rapists don’t have any religion or caste. It comes under the category of obvious crimes,” she had told the students.\n\nThe professor reportedly also spoke about powerful people who were accused of rape, including “Patils and Deshmukhs”, referring to historic titles given to village heads or territory holders.\n\nSome students recorded the classroom discussion and seemingly edited the conversation to show Desai saying that “[Mughal emperor] Aurangzeb was good” and “Patil and Deshmukh were rapists”.\n\nAfter the video went viral on social media, the college administration forced the professor to go on leave.\n\nDesai has claimed that she never said the things shown in the video – and that it was edited and taken out of context.\n\nShe told Newslaundry that she came to know about the video only when the police came to the college for an inquiry.\n\nThe professor said that while the college authorities supported her, she was asked to apologize but she refused to do so.\n\n“In 1943, my father-in-law, who was a freedom fighter, had played a part in destroying the statue of British governor Wilson, where a Shivaji statue was built,” she told Newslaundry. “Ironically, I was asked to issue an apology in front of the same statue,” Desai added.\n\nAccording to Scroll, Desai has also filed a complaint with the police demanding action against those who edited the video and spread misinformation with the intention to “create a rift in the society”.\n\nIn their statement on the matter, the 88 academics urged the college authorities to allow Desai to return to work and ensure her safety.\n\n“Her assertion that rapists can be from any community is borne out by the most superficial glance at newspaper reports,” the statement said.\n\nMohan Vanrott, the director of Kolhapur Institute of Technology told Newslaundry that the college has “formed a committee” to “investigate” what had happened.\n\nIncidentally, in June this year, clashes had broken out between two groups in Kolhapur following a protest over WhatsApp statuses that allegedly ‘glorified’ Mughal emperor Tipu Sultan and 18th century Mysore ruler Aurangazeb.\n\n ",

      "description": "A gunfight erupted at a place between Awang Leikei in Meitei-majority Bishnupur and Kangvai in Kuki-majority Churachandpur districts. GUWAHATI: In the continued gunbattles in Manipur, three persons were killed while four others were injured on Friday.\n\nA gunfight erupted at a place between Awang Leikei in Meitei-majority Bishnupur and Kangvai in Kuki-majority Churachandpur districts around 1.30 am in which three persons – two from Churachandpur and one from Bishnupur – were killed and three others, all from Churachandpur, were injured. The injured were admitted to a hospital in Churachandpur.\n\nThe deceased included a teenager. He was killed after being hit by a bullet on the Imphal-Churachandpur highway in Bishnupur. The 19-year-old, who passed his higher secondary examination this year, was trying to take cover when the bullet hit him.\n\nAfter his killing, hundreds of locals, mostly women and youth, hit the streets and vented their ire. The students of the school where he studied also staged a protest.\n\nIn the afternoon, another gunfight erupted in the same area. A person from Churachandpur was injured.\n\nMeanwhile, a video has gone viral on social media showing one person being assaulted and another being fired upon by a group of unidentified persons. Local media reported both were killed two-three days ago. They were last seen on July 4 and they hailed from Kakching district in the Imphal valley.\n\nALSO READ | Games politicians play on Manipur battlefield\n\nThousands of women had staged a protest at the Sekmaijin Bazar bridge area on the outskirts of state capital Imphal on Thursday over the duo’s disappearance.\n\nIn Churachandpur, five CPI(M) MPs – Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, John Brittas, Santosh Kumar, Binay Vishwam and Subhrayam – visited two relief camps on Friday.\n\nThe leaders of Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum held a brief interaction with the MPs and submitted a memorandum to them. They are also likely to visit some relief camps in the Imphal valley.\n\nMeanwhile, although the schools in the state reopened for classes 1-8 after two months on Wednesday, attendance in the violence-hit districts is very thin. Locals said parents were afraid of sending their wards to schools given the continued violence.\n\nThe ethnic clashes broke out on May 3 after a “tribal solidarity march” which was organised by a students’ organisation to oppose the move for the inclusion of majority Meitei community in the Scheduled Tribes list.

      "description": "The IndianOil&#39;s Assam Oil Division made the offer after finding that a large number of PMUY customers were not refilling their cylinders due to various reasons. GUWAHATI: The Indian Oil Corporation Limited has merely a few takers for its \"take home two 5 kg composite cylinders in exchange for 14.2 kg metallic cylinder\" offer under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY).\n\nThe IndianOil’s Assam Oil Division (AOD) made the offer after observing that a large number of customers under the PMUY were not refilling their cylinders due to various reasons including non-affordability and the option of cooking using firewood.\n\nThe refill price of 5 kg composite cylinders is proportionate to the 14.2 kg red cylinder. In the past one year, the Indian Oil Corporation managed to push only 1 lakh 5 kg composite cylinders.\n\nAssam has 44.14 lakh PMUY beneficiaries and an estimated 25% of them did not go for refill. \n\nG Ramesh, Executive Director and head of IndianOil’s AOD, said the government had introduced the 5 kg cylinders after observing the difficulties a section of PMUY beneficiaries were facing with refill.\n\n“We offered the 5 kg cylinders as we thought that would be a cheaper option,” he said.\n\nSaurav Chaliha, who is IndianOil’s General Manager (HR-CSR), said people in rural Assam tend to rely more on firewood than LPG for cooking.  \n\nRaj Jyoti Das, who is IndianOil’s Deputy General Manager (LPG Sales), said the response to composite cylinders was not good.\n\n“The feedback we have received from the ground is that many such PMUY beneficiaries argue why they should take two small cylinders in exchange for a bigger one,” Das said. \n\nThe IndianOil has launched a 10 kg see-through cylinder which is covered with a composite layer of polymer-wrapped fibreglass and fitted with an HDPE outer jacket. It costs Rs 821.\n\n‘Chhotu’, a mini cooking gas cylinder of 5 kg, has been also launched especially for catering to migrant populations in urban and semi-urban areas who do not have local address proof, people with lower gas consumption and commercial establishments with limited space.\n\nAn option for the struggling PMUY beneficiaries could be “Munna”, a 2 kg cylinder, which will be launched soon. A cylinder will cost Rs 247.\n  ",
