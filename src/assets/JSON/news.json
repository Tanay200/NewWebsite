AHMEDABAD: Three people found guilty of spying for the Pakistani intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) were sentenced to life imprisonment on Monday. \n\nThe Ahmedabad sessions court headed by Additional principal judge A.R Patel found the three accused Sirajuddin Karmatali Fakir, Mohammad Ayub, and Navsad Maksudali Saiyed, guilty under sections 121 (waging war against the government), 121A (conspiracy to commit offences punishable under 121), 123 (Concealing with intent to facilitate design to wage war) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code. 75 witnesses have given testimony against the accused.\n\nThe Ahmedabad Crime Branch received information in October 2012 that a few residents were functioning as ISI agents. It investigated and apprehended Jamalpur residents Sirajuddin alias Raju Fakir and Muhammadaiyub alias Sakir Shaikh, seizing evidence including mobile phones and filing a FIR.\n\nAccording to the investigation, Sirajuddin Fakir travelled to Pakistan in 2007 and met Taimur, a Pakistani spy, where he got training to identify the ranks of army officers and vehicles, and how to communicate information securely.\n\n“Sirajuddin was willing to perform anti-Indian operations if Taimur offered him money in exchange for intelligence on the army. After returning to India, Sirajuddin worked as a dealer, supplying eggs to various army camps in order to gather information. After re-keying the BSF camps in Rajasthan, Kutch, Gandhinagar, and Ahmedabad, Sirajuddin conveyed extremely sensitive information, including troop movements, to Pakistan in two separate e-mail draught boxes. Sirajuddin first enlisted the assistance of Mohammed Ayub alias Sakir Sheikh to complete the e-mail.”\n\nThe crime branch charged Sirajuddin alias Karamat Ali Fakir, Mohammad Ayub alias Sakir Shabbirbhai Sheikh, and Naushad Ali Maksudali Ali Saiyed in this case. In which 9 foreign defendants, including Pakistani handlers Taimur and Tahir, were listed as wanted.\n\nAccording to public prosecutor Bharat Patni, there is proof that between May 2010 and September 2012, Pakistani Taimur sent Rs 1.94 lakh through various money transfer companies in the names of several people in the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\n\nSirajuddin has allegedly been imprisoned since his arrest in 2012, while the other two were released on bond, according to his defence attorneys.

      "description": "While the BJP retained power with an impressive majority in UP in March 2022, the Bihar-based Bhojpuri singer received a notice under Section 160 CrPc from Kanpur police around 11 months later.  BHOPAL: The assembly polls-bound Madhya Pradesh is witnessing an interesting battle of songs between two women poets-singers -- the Bihar-based Neha Singh Rathore and Bundelkhand (UP)-based Anamika Jain Amber.\n\nThe battle between the two young women poets-singers dates back to the 2021-22 assembly poll season of adjoining Uttar Pradesh.\n\nA few months before the assembly polls in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh in the spring of 2022, Neha Singh Rathore came out with a popular Bhojpuri composition, “UP Mein Ka Ba,” which targeted the Yogi Adityanath led state government on a host of issues. \n\nJust a few weeks later, the Lalitpur-UP-born Anamika Jain Amber responded to Neha’s number with her Bundeli composition, “UP Mein Baba Hain-UP Mein Baba,” which narrated the achievements of the BJP government in the politically crucial north Indian state.\n\nWhile the BJP retained power with an impressive majority in UP in March 2022, the Bihar-based Bhojpuri singer received a notice under Section 160 CrPc from Kanpur police around 11 months later. \n\nRathore allegedly inciting hatred among people through her composition, ‘UP Mein Ka Ba- Season 2,’ was one of the multiple complaints against her. \n\nFive months later, another BJP-ruled state Madhya Pradesh, is proving to be an ideal ground for a revival of the battle of songs between the two young women poets-singers, ahead of the year-end assembly polls.\n\nNeha who was recently booked by Bhopal police on a ruling BJP leader’s complaint over her social media post, allegedly linking RSS with the shocking urination on a tribal man episode in MP’s Sidhi district, recently released on social media a composition, “MP Mein Ka Ba” on the lines of her highly popular ‘UP Mein Ka Ba’ song.\n\nThe 1.27 minutes song which was shared widely on social media platforms, particularly by the opposition Congress and its leaders, targeted the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in MP, on a host of issues, including the recent case of urination on tribal man by an alleged BJP man, the collapse of 6 statues at Ujjain’s Mahakal Lok temple corridor and the alleged irregularities in the MP Patwari Recruitment Exam.\n\nJust when the Congress leaders were lapping up and sharing Rathore’s Bhojpuri song aggressively, came Anamika Jain Amber’s response to Rathore through the composition, ‘Mama Magic Karat Hain-Modi Magic Karat Hain.”\n\nIn the song released on social media on Sunday, Anamika starts by telling that her composition is a reply to those who have started questioning ‘Ka Ba-Ka Ba’ (what’s there) in poll-bound MP too just like UP in the past. \n\n“Since they’re asking what is there in MP, I talked to people in MP and am subsequently informing what magic has been woven by PM Narendra Modi and CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan in MP.” ",

Rather, consuming excess sugar can spark chronic inflammation, which can play a role in cancer development. Cutting out all sugar does not fight existing tumors, as every cell requires glucose. Cancer patients should follow a healthy, balanced diet that has plenty of whole fruits and vegetables. Cutting out excess added sugar and pairing carbohydrates with protein helps prevent spikes in glucose that can increase cancer risk. Experts suggest avoiding sugar substitutes until more data is available.",

The Rs 2,771-crore minor lift irrigation project, via an underground pipeline system, will render irrigation facilities to more than 75,000-hectare land owned by 1.25 lakh-plus farmers in the Dhar district. The project once completed will ensure irrigation facilities through sprinkler and drip systems under PM Narendra Modi’s One Drop More Crop vision.\n\nThe CM subsequently unveiled two minor irrigation projects in the Barwani district, including the Rs 1,173 crore project in Nagalwadi and the Rs 55 crore project in the Pati area of the west MP district. The twin micro-irrigation projects will usher adequate micro-irrigation facilities to hundreds of villages in Barwani and the neighbouring Khargone district.\n\nChouhan later carried out an impressive roadshow in Barwani town of Barwani district.

Nowadays they’ve got a video made which talks about Ka Ba Ka Ba.”\n\nChouhan said while referring to Bhojpuri singer Neha Singh Rathore’s trending video targeting BJP rule in MP, which is being shared by the Congress leaders on social media platforms. “It’s because the Congress is unable to come to power due to me that its leaders are abusing me. Do my sisters here also think that I’m Kans or Shakuni Mama,” Chouhan said.\n\nCong regime stopped funds: CM\nOn a month-long ‘festival,’ CM Chouhan accused the erstwhile Kamal Nath-led 15-month Congress regime of stopping funds for various welfare schemes of his previous government, including the CM Kanya Vivah/Nikah Yojana, the Sambal Yojana and the scheme pertaining to distribution of laptops to meritorious students.

NEW DELHI:   A group of 26 women associated with the three armed forces will participate in an over 900-km bike rally on the eve of Kargil Vijay Diwas. The all-woman bike rally will begin at the National War Memorial (NWM) in Delhi on July 18 and culminate at the Kargil War Memorial in Drass on July 26. \nThe rally will be flagged off by Indian Army Chief General Manoj Pande and Army Wives’ Welfare Association President Archana Pande.\n\nThe bike rally is being organised to commemorate the brave hearts who made their supreme sacrifice in protecting the sovereignty and integrity of the country during the 1999 Kargil conflict with the Pakistani Army. “The rally is aimed at showcasing the bold and indomitable spirit of women through the women bikers, thereby contributing to the mission of ‘Nari Sashaktikaran’ at the national level,” said an official.\n\nAmong the 26 bikers, the participants include serving women officers and non-commissioned officers, spouses of serving and retired personnel and ‘veer naris’. The widow of an armed forces personnel, who has laid down his life for the nation, whether in war or in a military operation, is called a ‘veer nari’. There are two veer naris from the Indian Army, and 14 serving officers, including 11 from Indian Army, two from Indian Air Force and one from Indian Navy. Besides, there are two non-commissioned officers.\nAlso, eight women who are either the spouses of serving or retired officers are also participating in the nine-day-long bike expedition. Two officers have been kept in reserve as well.\n\nBeginning from NWM in Delhi, the bikers will be passing through the cities and towns of states like Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir to reach the destination in Ladakh.\nThe rally is being conducted under the aegis of HQ Northern Command.\n\nKargil Vijay Diwas has been named after the successful Kargil military campaign named Operation Vijay. On this day, India successfully reclaimed command of the high outposts that were treacherously occupied by Pakistani intruders during winter months.\n\nThe Kargil conflict was a three-month-long skirmish between India and Pakistan. It commenced in May 1999, when approximately 1,500 Pakistani soldiers intruded into the Indian Territory in Kargil of Jammu and Kashmir with an aim of severing the link between Kashmir and Ladakh.\n\nBrave soldiers of the Indian Army had recaptured the dominating peaks after overcoming the seemingly insurmountable odds, hostile terrain and weather. By July 20, the Indian forces managed to recapture Kargil heights. \n\nCommemorating the grand victory\nDuring Kargil conflict, 674 Indian soldiers made the supreme sacrifice and were awarded four Param Vir Chakras, 10 Maha Vir Chakras and 70 Vir Chakras, among others for gallantry. The IAF and Army operation was named Operation Safed Sagar. This year marks the 24th anniversary of that grand victory. ",

NEW DELHI:   It has been over ten-and-a-half months since the eight naval veterans were taken into custody by Qatar’s interior ministry and with no clarity on when the trial will end, some members have filed a mercy petition to the Emir of Qatar to grant them pardon.\n\n“Since most of the veterans are aged above 60 years, their health has been adversely impacted by the trial. There is no clarity on the charges that have been levelled against them. They are based on sections under Qatari law, so little is known about how long the case would last.\n\nDuring the last hearing on June 21, two of the investigators were tried and the next hearing is on July 19. There is uncertainty about how long this trial will continue. It is for the same reason that some family members have filed a mercy petition and are pleading to the Emir to pardon the veterans,” said a source.\n\nThe Emir typically issues pardons twice a year, during Ramadan and National Day. No official information regarding those released is usually disclosed, unless the pardons involve expats, in which case their consulates sometimes share information about the releases.\n\nThe families of the veterans say that the Emir of Qatar is known to be benevolent and they are hopeful of their plea being considered. Meanwhile, families of the naval veterans are being allowed to meet them once a week and phone calls are also facilitated for those who have families back home and are not able to travel to Doha.\n\n“Every time we spoke to our kin in Doha over the phone, he maintains that they have not done anything unlawful,” said a family member of one of the veterans. “The case is in what is called ‘The Court of First Instance’. Four hearings have taken place.\n\nOur Embassy is closely following it. The full nature of the charges is not entirely clear. We are ensuring that our nationals are receiving the required legal assistance. The family members continue to receive weekly phone calls and meetings. They are being updated with the proceedings of the case on a regular basis,” said Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi recently.  When the tide turns in favour of these eight naval veterans and they are actually repatriated; only time will tell.\n\nWAITING IN CONFINEMENT \n\nAugust 30, 2022\nEight naval veterans (Captain Navtej Singh Gill, Captain Birendra Kumar Verma, Captain Saurabh Vasisht, Commander Amit Nagpal, Commander Purnendu Tiwari, Commander Sugunakar Pakala, Commander Sanjeev Gupta and sailor Ragesh) are taken away from their homes in Doha by Qatar’s Ministry of Interior for questioning.

      "description": "The soft release centre is a place where animals are placed in pre-release cages located close to the location where they will be released. RANCHI:  Once considered to be a Maoist hotbed, Budha Pahar will soon become a soft release centre for Chital and help improve the tiger and leopard population in Palamu Tiger Reserve (PTR). According to forest officials, a proposal has been sent to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) for approval and the project will be started as soon as they get a nod from the authority.\n\nThe soft release centre is a place where animals are placed in pre-release cages located close to the location where they will be released. After some time, the animals are allowed to go out, but they have an option of returning to the cage for shelter, water and food.\n\nNotably, Budha Pahad, spread over a 55 sq km area was freed from Maoists’ control after 32 years following three coordinated operations carried out by the security forces since April last year. Considered to be the last bastion of Maoists in Jharkhand, Budha Pahar had been a safe haven for Maoists for over three decades due to its difficult topography and inaccessible terrain.\n\nAfter freeing the area from rebels, for the first time, CRPF and Jharkhand police jointly hoisted the Tricolour on October 23 last year. PTR officials informed that the idea behind the project is to increase the prey base for the predators in the local ecosystem.\n\n“As we have to increase the prayer base for the tiger and leopards in the region, a proposal has been sent to NTCA for setting up a soft release centre for Chital at Budha Pahar and the work will be started as soon as we get a nod from the centre. Initially, nearly 50 Chital from Betla National Forest will be shifted here and released gradually in the nearby jungles as its population starts increasing,” said PTR Field Director Kumar Ashutosh. \n\nAs animals are released gradually into the nearby jungles, it is called a soft release centre, he added. According to the PTR Director, the population of Chital is expected to double in a year and will multiply further in a similar way in the soft release centre. \n\nThe decision has been taken looking to the fact that the population of Chital in Batla National Park is in access and hence they will be shifted to other places with an intention to increase the prayer base all over the PTR, he said. “Besides being a part of the tiger corridor that stretches from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra, Budha Pahar region also has a good number of leopard populations proved through the camera traps.\n\nSoft release Centre\nThe soft release centre is a place where animals are placed in pre-release cages located close to the location where they will be released. After some time, the animals are allowed to go out, however, they are given an option of returning to the cage for shelter, water and food.  ",

KOLKATA:  Deadly political rivalry within the family surfaced in a Malda village after a youth allegedly murdered his BJP activist father after his TMC candidate wife was defeated by a candidate of the saffron camp in the just-concluded panchayat polls.\n\nThe body of Buran Murmu (52) was found hanging from the ceiling in his room with multiple injury marks on the body and his son Biplab disappeared. An altercation between the father and son broke out after Biplab’s wife Sharmila lost to a BJP candidate by 56 votes.\n\nThe police detained Sharmila for interrogation and are looking for Biplab. “Sharmila’s paternal family has been loyal to the TMC. The trouble in the family broke after she was selected as a TMC candidate. Buran was an active BJP worker and he could not accept that his daughter-in-law would represent a rival party.  After Sharmila’s defeat, Biplab held his father responsible alleging that Buran campaigned against Sharmila asking their neighbours not to vote for her,” a cop said.

      "description": "The sports department expects around 50 lakh participants during the event. RAIPUR:  The overwhelming response witnessed during the first ever ‘Chhattisgarhiya Olympics’ sports event organised last year enthused the state government to prepone the traditional games contest, which is to commence today.\n\nSpearheaded by chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, the day of the start of the two-month-long Chhattisgarhiya Olympics 2023-24 in an election year coincides with the popular local festival ‘Hareli Tihaar’ (Hareli means greenery).\n\nThe sports department expects around 50 lakh participants during the event. The state has 1.95 crore electorates as per the updated list. Besides the recognition of certificates and medals, the total prize money to be distributed will be close to Rs 10 crore.\n\nThe local Olympics event is divided into six phases in which participants of all ages, from children to the elderly in both male and female segments are encouraged to join as competitors. The event has 16 traditional games, including both team and single categories. This year, rope jumping and wrestling are new additions under the single category.\n\nThe competitive games will run simultaneously in rural and urban areas. Three different age groups have been earmarked for the players: up to 18 years, 18-40 years and above 40 years. The show will conclude on September 27, offering enough opportunities for the players to showcase their skills and compete further at a higher level.\n\nThere are a series of competitions at various levels, starting right from the primary level — Rajiv Yuva Mitan (Youth Friends’) club using a knock-out format followed by zonal, block, district, divisional and finally the state level. Across the state, there are 13,261 Mitan clubs where over 35.65 lahks participate as players.\n\nThe event has been conceptualised to revive various traditional sports that gradually seem to be disappearing in almost every state.

      "description": "According to sources, leaders of at least 24 ‘like-minded’ parties will attend the meeting, called by the Congress, to chalk out strategies to forge an anti-BJP front in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. NEW DELHI:  The second edition of the meeting of Opposition parties is set to begin in Bengaluru on Monday on a stronger footing with the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) resolving their differences over the Centre’s ordinance on control of services in Delhi. \n\nAccording to sources, leaders of at least 24 ‘like-minded’ parties will attend the meeting, called by the Congress, to chalk out strategies to forge an anti-BJP front in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. The leaders will attend a dinner hosted by Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Monday evening, followed by formal meetings the next day. \n\nThe AAP decided to participate in the meeting on Sunday, a day after the Congress said it would oppose the Centre’s ordinance. “Not only the Delhi ordinance, we will not support any attempt to sabotage federalism in the country,” said AICC general secretary (organisation) K C Venugopal. \n\nEarlier, the AAP had said that it would not attend the joint Opposition meeting if the Congress doesn’t publicly denounce the ordinance. A galaxy of prominent Opposition leaders is expected to attend the Bengaluru meet, including Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, and Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad, among others. \n\nThis is the second joint meeting of Opposition parties to chalk out a strategy to fight the BJP in 2024. The first meeting was convened by Bihar CM Nitish Kumar in Patna on June 23. The BRS, YSRCP, and BJD are unlikely to attend the meeting. They had skipped the first meeting, too. While the session is taking place amid a vertical split in the NCP, party leaders said it will not dampen unity efforts. \n\nCPI(M) Rajya Sabha M P Elamaram Kareem told TNIE that internal contradictions among regional parties won’t hamper attempts to cobble a common front against the BJP at the national level, adding that the meeting will discuss pragmatic ways to recalibrate strategies in state-level alliances.  “Our common minimum goal is to defeat the BJP in the next election,” said RSP MP N K Premachandran.\n\nBJP downplays Oppn meet\nThe BJP sought to downplay the Bengaluru meet, saying the opposition parties are a ‘divided lot’ and have no specific programme other than to defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  ",

      "description": "The BJP considers regional parties and their influential leaders as a major threat to their winning prospects in 2024, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) founder Sharad Pawar said. MUMBAI:  The BJP considers regional parties and their influential leaders as a major threat to their winning prospects in 2024, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) founder Sharad Pawar said. That’s the reason the saffron party wants to break regional parties such as the NCP, the veteran leader told TNIE in an exclusive interview. \n\n“The BJP is using all their might and resources to divide the regional parties... Due to these parties, the BJP is struggling to expand its footprint beyond the North belt,” he added. He, however, cautioned that forging Opposition unity against the BJP is going to be a big challenge. “Opposition parties have to understand that it is not an easy task. They need to be united if they want to defeat the BJP in 2024 Lok Sabha elections,” he said. \n\nCiting the differences among the opposition parties due to the dynamics of regional politics, Pawar said these ‘practical difficulties’ can’t be ignored. “For example, in West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee’s TMC and the Congress are rivals and, hence, can’t easily come together against the BJP. The same issue is in Kerala and other states. If these practical and genuine issues among Opposition parties are not sorted out, then we need to keep open the window of unity post elections... We have to prepare for different types of political scenarios,” he said. \n\nPawar advised parties not to stretch their differences or criticise each other in such a way that it will cut down communication lines and strain relationships. Meanwhile, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who led the rebellion against Pawar senior, and other leaders from his camp including Praful Patel met the veteran leader on Sunday. They requested the senior leader’s support to keep the NCP united. “We asked him (Sharad Pawar) to think about our request over the next some days and guide us. He listened to us quietly but said nothing,” said Praful Patel.  ",

      "description": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi-headed Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has rejected a proposal sent by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) \n\nTension Within\nPMO denies extension to Gadkari’s key men in NHAI\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi-headed Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has rejected a proposal sent by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for extending the tenure of its two top officials – Member (Technical) Mahabir Singh and Member (Projects) Manoj Kumar. They look after the critical aspects of the NHAI, India’s largest road and bridge builder. Sources said Singh and Kumar are considered close to Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari. The NHAI, which functions under Gadkari’s ministry, had sought a two-year extension for these officers. Mahabir Singh was appointed NHAI’s Member (Technical) in July 2020 for three years. His term expires this month-end. Manoj Kumar’s term has also come to an end. According to sources, the Prime Minister’s Office was not happy with the performance of the two officers.\n\nPulling Apart \nBJP’s RS pick brings focus on division of Bengal\n\nThe BJP leadership’s choice of Ananta Rai Maharaj as its candidate to represent West Bengal in the Rajya Sabha has reignited the debate on the division of West Bengal and the formation of a separate state comprising some districts of north Bengal and Assam. Ananta Rai is a leader of Koch-Rajbanshis and has been a votary of a separate state of ‘Greater Cooch Behar”. Rai heads the Greater Cooch Behar People’s Association, working to carve out a separate state from Bengal.\n\n The BJP-led Union government is also in talks with Jibon Singha, chief of the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO). KLO has been engaged in an armed struggle to create a separate state comprising north Bengal districts. Several BJP legislators from north Bengal have openly backed the demand for the division of Bengal. Union Minister of State for home affairs Nisith Pramanik, an MP from north Bengal, had earlier responded to a question about his government’s plan to divide Bengal by saying, “decision will be taken keeping in mind the people’s sentiments”. Pramanik accompanied Rai when the latter filed his nomination in the West Bengal assembly. The chatter for a new state is getting louder.\n\nLegislating for Lawmakers \nCong may change stand on instant disqualification\n\nChief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud’s comments last week that the courts cannot put a life ban on politicians who have been convicted and barred from contesting election has triggered discussion in the Congress on the disqualification issue. The CJI made the comment while hearing a petition on the period of disqualification filed in 2016. It was the Supreme Court’s decision in the Lily Thomas Vs Union of India case in 2013 that resulted in the instant disqualification of MPs, MLAs and MLCs, who are convicted in a criminal case for two years or more. The then Congress-led government had moved swiftly to overturn the Supreme Court’s decision by bringing in an ordinance. But it was thwarted by Rahul Gandhi who tore the ordinance in a press conference calling it “complete nonsense”. This forced the government not to pass a bill to turn the ordinance into law. The party’s opinion on the issue has, however, changed over time, primarily as it feels that “the ruling BJP was using flimsy grounds to get lawmakers disqualified”. Sources said Congress is now in sync with other opposition parties who plan to bring in laws to protect lawmakers from being targeted by the central government. ",

MUMBAI: In the brief history of CM Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, a moment came months ago: prominent leaders, then in the ruling Sena and tied to the MVA, revolted, saying the then finance minister Ajit Pawar had deprived them of development funds. The noise made little impact.\n\nFast-forward to Friday.\n\nThe Shinde government chose the same Ajit Pawar to head the finance and planning ministry amid strong objections from the chief minister’s loyalist MLAs. Political grapevine has it that on Friday, top BJP leadership told Shinde that it was a part of the “deal” with the NCP to allocate finance to Ajit Pawar.\n\nDeepak Kesarkar, a Shiv Sena minister, said the finance ministry is with Ajit Pawar, but the final decision will be taken by Shinde. “That’s why we are not much concerned,” he said.\n\nThe Friday reallocation of ministries was done in a manner that not only saw Shiv Sena ministers losing key portfolios but also some BJP ministers who too lost their key positions at the cost of NCP ministers.\n\nNCP’s Dhananjay Munde got the agriculture ministry. In the earlier MVA government, the close aide of Ajit Pawar had a low-key portfolio of social justice. NCP minister Chhagan Bhujbal has got the food and civil supply ministry while another NCP minister Dilip Walse Patil will now head the cooperation ministry that will help his party to control and retain its cooperative-related vote bank in western Maharashtra.\n\nHasan Mushriff, another NCP minister, got the medical education ministry while Dharma Baba Atram bagged the food and drugs ministry.\n\nThe only woman NCP minister Aditi Tatkare heads the women and child development ministry and NCP’s Anil Patil has got rehabilitation and disaster management.\n\nOn July 2, senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar and eight other legislators of his party took oath as ministers in the Maharashtra government.\n\nThe surprise move led to a split in the Sharad Pawar-led outfit.\n\n(With additional inputs from Online Desk) ",

NEW DELHI:  In a bid to strengthen the country’s farming sector, the government on Friday released an action plan for the formation of 1,100 new Farmer Producer Organisations (FPO). The FPOs are entities collectively formed by farmers, enabling them to pool resources and improve their produce and profits.\n\nThe plan was released by Union Home Minister Amit Shah during the inaugural session of the day-long mega conclave ‘Strengthening PACS (primary agricultural credit society) through FPOs’, organised by the National Cooperative Development Corporation, in collaboration with the Union Ministry of Cooperation in the national capital. \n\nIn his address, the home minister said that “in such a large country, where about 65 crore people are engaged in agriculture, it has become very essential to revive the cooperative movement, modernise it, bring transparency in it and aim to achieve new heights.”\n\nShah said in the field of agriculture and rural development, every person can be made prosperous only through cooperative movements. He further said that it does not matter whether one has capital or not, “but if one has the courage and passion to work hard and the ability to take oneself forward, then the cooperative movement is a great medium to make those who lack capital prosperous.” \n\nAccording to Shah, the Modi government has taken adequate initiatives to extend support at every level — from the production to marketing of the products — for the FPOs made through PACS. These FPOs have the highest potential to make farmers prosperous, and all associated ministries will work together with the mantra of three-pronged rural development and prosperity through PACS, FPOs and self-help groups, Shah asserted.\n\n“We have to move away from traditional methods and adopt modern methods of agriculture with time to make the country’s marginal farmers prosperous, and PACs’ FPO is the beginning of this,” the minister added. The initiative covers economic activities based on agriculture, animal husbandry and fisheries which are the backbone of the Indian economy. These three sectors make up 18 per cent of India’s GDP today, boosting them means boosting the country’s economy, he said. ",

NEW DELHI:  In a development that could help millions of children with autism and related neuro-developmental disorders in India and other low-income countries,  a new app that tells autism behaviour has been successfully tested.\n\nAt present, a diagnosis of autism typically depends on clinical assessments by highly-trained professionals, using rich resources. It is a challenge in low-income settings. The new app called START (Screening Tools for Autism Risk using Technology) was tested at homes by non-specialist healthcare workers, educated to the high school level, using researchers from India, the UK and the US. The app was tested with 131 two- to eleven-year-olds living in poor neighbourhoods of Delhi.\n\nThe research was funded by a grant from UKRI Medical Research Council Global Challenges Research Fund. Children with autistic conditions preferred looking at geometric patterns rather than social scenes. They are fascinated by predictable, repetitive sensory stimuli and have more trouble completing precise tasks with their hands.\n\nThe app includes tasks, a questionnaire, and observational assessments of aspects of behaviour that index social, sensory and motor function. Individual metrics from each task show a consistent pattern of differences between typically and atypically developing children. Combining the information from multiple measures within the app resulted in high classification accuracy for the three groups of children – autism spectrum conditions; intellectual disability and typically developing.\n\nThe app was 86 per cent accurate in identifying children with any neurodevelopmental disorders, and 78 per cent accurate in specifically identifying autism. This performance is significantly higher than standard screening assessments for neurodevelopmental disorders used by non-specialists. The results could help faster identification of children with autism.\n  ",

While the first birth took place on July 6, three others were born on July 9, and the fifth one on July 10.\n\nAccording to the Etawah Safari authorities, who kept the death of the lion cubs a closely guarded secret initially, out of five cubs born, three had died by July 10.\n\nWhile two cubs were stillborn and one was very weak and could not survive. The fourth one, which had taken birth along with two others on July 9, died on Thursday and now the vets were monitoring the condition of the only surviving cub.\n\nAt around 8.30 am on Thursday, the condition of the fourth cub started deteriorating. There was swelling in its stomach and the cub had difficulty in breathing too.\n\nDoctors attending the newborn said that at 11.55 am, the body became still, said the officials while interacting with media persons after the primary probe by the director’s office of the park.\n\nLioness Sona is also under medical observation and has gradually started eating meals. She had not been eating since her delivery. “Breathing issue is stated to be the primary cause of death. A post-mortem examination will reveal further details,” said officials.\n\nAccording to the officials, the experts claimed that the survival of the cubs of the first pregnancy of the lioness was difficult and if the number of cubs delivered was more, the chances were even bleaker.\n\nMeanwhile, after the first three deaths, the two surviving cubs were kept in a wooden enclosure with a barrier on all sides and mesh above to allow air to circulate, said the authorities adding that the cubs were moving inside the cot and trying to open their eyes.\n\nHowever, the one born on July 10 has survived and is under medical observation. It is being fed artificially. Even the safari authorities had got in touch with experts from Gujarat over the development.\n\nThe officials also said that it was rare for a lioness to give birth to cubs over a period of four days. “Lionesses take a maximum of 24 to 30 hours to give birth to cubs. There is no research available about this either. Dehradun Wildlife Institute authorities have also been contacted to study why this happened,” said the official, adding, “In this case, lioness Sona gave birth to five cubs in a period of 100 hours which is not common.”\n\nThe Etawah safari with a perimeter of 8 km is one of the biggest in Asia. It is being established in an area of 350 hectares with a plan for a lion safari, a deer safari, an antelope safari, a bear safari, and a leopard safari. ",

The combined storage of these dams is 97 per cent above the last 10-year average. CHANDIGARH/DEHRADUN:  As the gushing waters from rivers, drains and barrages batter the north-western belt of the country, the Central Water Commission (CWC) on July 13 revealed that the water levels in the Bhakra, Pong and Kol dams in Himachal Pradesh are almost double than the normal for this time of the year. The combined storage of these three dams is 97 per cent above the last 10-year average.\n\nThe water level in Thein Dam in Punjab, too, is 64 per cent more than the decade-long average. At least 108 persons have died, an equal number of people injured and at least a dozen are missing due to rain-related incidents and road accidents since the onset of monsoon on June 24 till July 13.\n\nThe bodies of people killed in flash floods are being recovered in Kullu and Mandi districts. So far 53 landslides and 22 flashfloods have hit the state, as per the data released today evening by the Himachal emergency operations centre. The state is likely to get heavy rain at isolated places till July 18 and the MeT office has issued a yellow alert.\n\nThe CWC data says the total combined capacity of the Bhakra, Pong and Kol dams is 12.475 billion cubic metres (BCM) and at present the storage is 7.606 BCM. Last year at this time it was 2.265 BCM and the average storage has been 3.855 BCM.\n\nWhile yesterday the water level at Bhakra was 497.18 meters against the reservoir level of 512.06 meters. Thus the reservoir of the dam is filled up to 56 per cent of its total capacity this year compared to 21 per cent at the same time last year. The average of the last 10 years is 37 per cent.\n\nThe picture is no different at the Pong dam as the water level at the dam was 416.22 m yesterday against the total level of 423.67 meters, thus 67 per cent of the dam is full compared to 15 per cent at the same time last year.\n\nSources said due to heavy rains in the catchment areas of these dams, the inflow into these dams had been extraordinarily high since last week. The authorities had decided not to release excess water from these dams as already there is a heavy water influx in rivers and streams downstream and many areas are flooded.\n\nThe Bhakra Beas Management Board is monitoring the situation and a decision to release additional water from these dams would be taken in consultation with the partner states depending on the level of inflows and the demand for water, said sources. The Himachal police are now focusing on inaccessible areas and low mobile connectivity to trace stranded persons. “Rescue operation is on,’’ said officiating DGP Satwant Atwal.\n\nInflows into dams due to rain in catchments\n\nThe CWC data says the total combined capacity of the Bhakra, Pong and Kol dams is 12.475 billion cubic metres (BCM).

The Badrinath Yatra has been disrupted again due to landslides and torrential rains. Dehradun has lost rail connectivity with other parts of the country due to heavy debris on the railway track near Haridwar.\n\nAccording to the State Meteorological Centre, \"The weather in the state is expected to remain the same till July 18.

The flood rescue team efficiently carried out rescue operations with rafts, ducky boats, and remotely operated life-boys,\" said Commandant Manikant Mishra.\n\nBesides Haridwar, monsoon rains have also caused massive landslides and road blockades in Pithoragarh district.

GUWAHATI: After a lull of three days, fresh gunfights erupted at two places across Manipur on Sunday.\n\nThe violence first broke out on the border of the Bishnupur-Churachandpur districts in the morning.\n\nSenior police officials were not available for comment but locals feared casualties. Some houses were also torched. Security forces, deployed in the area, brought the situation under control.\n\nLater in the day, another gunbattle occurred on the border of Imphal West and Kangpokpi districts. Casualties, if any, were not known.\n\nMeanwhile, the police arrested four persons in connection with the killing of a Naga woman, Lucy Marem, in the Imphal East district on Saturday evening. The assailants had allegedly also disfigured her face.\n\nThe victim was reportedly suffering from schizophrenia. \n\nBefore this incident, the Nagas, the third major community of Manipur, were unaffected by the ethnic violence between Meiteis and Kukis. \n\nThe United Naga Council (UNC) condemned the killing, stating that the innocent woman was murdered despite her assailants knowing that she was a Naga.\n\nIt demanded that the state government immediately constitute a judicial inquiry committee, arrest all perpetrators of the crime, including the members of a women’s group who had allegedly apprehended the victim and handed her over to armed men, and award exemplary punishment to the culprits.\n\nThe organisation warned, “In the event of not fulfilling our demands within 48 hours, further course of action will be initiated.” \n\nFurther, the UNC said, “The Meitei civil society organizations will be equally held responsible for this despicable act. Hence, their role and position must be made known to all concerned.”\n\nIt said a 12-hour “total shutdown” would be observed in all Naga areas of Manipur from 6 am to 6 pm on Monday as a mark of resentment for the woman’s murder and to pay tribute to her.\n\nThis is the second such killing of a woman. On July 6, a Kuki woman was shot dead by an unidentified gunman on the outskirts of Imphal.\n\nMeanwhile, the Committee on Tribal Unity has called for a 72-hour “total shutdown” of National Highway 2 – Manipur’s lifeline – in protest against Saturday’s torching of three LPG cylinders-laden trucks in Imphal West district and Sunday’s arson attack at a village.
