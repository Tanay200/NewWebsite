          "image": "",
          "description": "The Indian automotive industry has operated without any formal planning or inclusion in government policies such as five-year plans. RC Bhargava, former CEO and current chairman of Maruti Suzuki, takes questions on a range of issues, from how the carmaker stayed on top and how he looks at future challenges. Excerpts from 6th edition of Delhi Dialogue, The New Indian Express\n\nThe Indian automotive industry has operated without any formal planning or inclusion in government policies such as five-year plans. It is difficult to believe that a government organisation could handle the pressure of VIP demands and vehicle registrations.\n\nShahid Faridi: Maruti started as a joint venture and it became a private company. How and when did it happen?\nThe government started with the intentions that the foreign company should take 40% equity. At that time, no foreign manufacturer wanted to actually put cash into the company. The other people who were offered to partner with Maruti wanted only to give second-hand equipment, but nobody wanted to invest.\n\nSuzuki, on its own, agreed to take 25% stake. Later they agreed to take 26% when they understood 26% gives them more rights.\n\nThen there was a revision in the contract within five years, and Suzuki was given an option of increasing its stake to 40%. So, they went up to 40% within five years.\n\nThen came 1991 liberalisation and we wanted foreign investments. The PMO told us to persuade Suzuki to increase its equity into Maruti and see if we could get any other foreign investment in the company.\nWe talked to Suzuki and it was decided that they will become equal partners with the government. In 1995, trouble started between the government and Suzuki. When they had become 50-50 partners, they said that the managing director would be the nominee from the partners, alternatively retiring in 1997.\n\nThere was a big difference of opinion on who should be the one. Ultimately, the issue went into an international arbitration. The government changed and Sikander Bakht became the Industries Minister. He realised that there is no way a government could run a car company. There were talks that we wanted Suzuki out but then Bakth negotiated and the court case was settled. He said the government would make money selling the shares. The government first gave Suzuki some shares so that it became the majority partner and the government took a premium of Rs 1,000 crore for giving Suzuki the control that time.\n\nMaruti got listed in 2003 and the government totally sold its shares after 2003-2007. \n\nDipak Mondal: What are the steps the government should take to increase manufacturing sector’s contribution in the GDP?\nFundamentally, the government can’t do much. However, one thing the government must do is to understand the value of time. You know the most costly thing for a big project is time. We are doing this project in Kharkhoda. Our people calculated that each day’s delay would cost us something like Rs 40 crore. In most government places, people are not willing to take decisions. Any project you want to do, you have to take so many approvals. It is one of the most frustrating things. \n\nDipak Mondal: Are you saying not much has changed on the ground?\nState governments decide on clearances. If something is not happening, we blame the Central government. However, all clearances, such as on electricity, water, sewerage, afforestation and the environment, are taken by state governments.\n\nMonika Yadav: What is your assessment of the rural consumption pattern? Do you think India can overtake US and China as a manufacturer in the automobile sector?\nI don’t think we can overtake China, probably not even the US. A major factor that we have to consider is the number of people in India is so large that if I want to get to the US standards, where they have more cars per thousand people, we would have 150 crore cars in India, which makes it impossible in terms of resources. \n\nChina is way ahead of us, especially in terms of infrastructure. Politically in India, it is impossible to do what China does in rebuilding rural infrastructure.\n\nOver the last 10-15 years, we have seen that the focus of growth has shifted from big cities. Given the infrastructure of cities like Delhi, it’s impossible for many more cars to fit into this place. A lot of people in rural areas are buying cars. We had recognised this trend about 10-15 years ago. Over 40% of our  total sales come from rural markets, including small towns.\n\nMonika Yadav: About artificial intelligence, do you think driverless cars are the future?\nThere are two aspects of it in India. One, it doesn’t make sense because we have so much unemployment, and drivers are a major source of employment. If you are selling 4 million cars, you are probably generating 7-8 lakh driver jobs every year. The other is a purely technical reason. For AI to grow, some degree of predictability is needed with some data. I don’t think any technologist today can predict the Indian behaviour.\n\nRakesh Kumar: What is your view on the semiconductor ecosystem in India?\nThe situation is improving. From what one is reading, following the PM’s recent visit to the US, is that there’s going to be more movement in that area in India. I think the chipmakers are recognising that the future growth market is India. \n\nNeha Periwal: Why Japanese, why not Germans?\nGermans, to some extent, are similar in a sense that they have a much higher involvement of employees in their companies. However, they haven’t managed to do what the Japanese have. And the cost is much higher. When we went for a partnership at that time, Volkswagen was interested. They even offered us a car, not the kind of a small car that Japan was using. Europe wasn’t using small cars. But then, they changed their mind. They thought India wasn’t a good market. Why Suzuki agreed to enter India, I have no idea.\n\nAmit Mukherjee: Do you think Maruti is late in entering the EV market?\nI don’t think that we are late in this (EV segment) market. \n\nWe had developed an electric car a few years ago. WagonR was converted, but the cost was too high. The Indian market is a much more price sensitive. Our Per Capita GDP is $2000 or so; Europe’s is $45,000. The cost of electric cars was not low at that time; the battery cost was quite high. The other big issue is that the major component of the car is the battery. Nobody is making batteries in India. And there was a lot of talk about battery technology. \n\nEven now, nobody is sure whether lithium ion batteries will be able to continue for five years from now. Who is going to invest in battery manufacturing? Then there is uncertainty behind the technology of batteries. You invest in a factory, the battery gets obsolete; you are stuck.\n\nPrabhu Chawla: You are shifting to EVs because of environmental concerns. Similar to the scrappage policy of petrol and diesel cars, would the EVs also be scrapped after 10 years?\nWe are introducing EVs correctly to improve the environment, and get nearer to carbon neutrality. The question is until we change the composition from predominantly coal-fired to renewable clean energy sources, are we really reducing the carbon footprint?\n\nA car should be scrapped if it fails to meet the environmental and safety standards.\n\nThis means there has to be periodical checking of fitness. We don’t have the infrastructure to do it. \n\nJitendra Choubey: Is there a dilemma in the industry whether we should go for EV or hydrogen?\nThe use of hydrogen on a commercial scale is not possible. You need big infrastructure and safety measures. In India, we have other options — created by a large agricultural, human and cattle waste — which offer you the possibility of compressed biogas and ethanol.\nWe look at hydrogen and electricity because the West is doing it. The West doesn’t have these options of cattle dung and agricultural waste. \n\nKetan Tanna: What is the future of affordable cars? \nIt is a tricky issue. We do need to provide cars that meet the best safety standards. But safety standards mean cost. Small cars become less affordable than big cars because the percentage increase in the price of the car is much higher, when the car itself is low-cost. Airbags in small cars and airbags for a big car don’t make much difference. However, if you put an airbag in a car costing Rs 50 lakh and you put it in a car costing five lakh, there’s a big difference in the impact. Thus, small cars have become less affordable. Therefore, their sales have more or less stagnated.\n\nWhat is the answer? One is that you reduce taxes on small cars. I’ve been saying that taxes on cars in India are the highest in the world. Europe has a VAT maximum of 19%, Japan has about 10% and the US has something similar to that. Our small cars go at about 29-30% and the big cars at 45%. \n\nArshad Khan: Carmakers are leaving India.\nHow many carmakers are there in the US, how many in Japan? How many do we have in India? How do you make them all viable? How can they all be profitable? The simple thing is India has partnered with carmakers. Many of them just didn’t make the cut. They have to fall out. We can’t support so many carmakers. \n\nArshad Khan: On Tesla…\nTesla is welcome as long as they work on the same basis of all other carmakers. People should have freedom to exit, and enter. Tesla has asked for some tax concessions earlier. They had said that they should be allowed to import cars at lower duties to test the market. So why should they be allowed to import cars at lower duty when nobody else is allowed to import? Now they’re not asking for that.\n\nNeha Periwal: What is the best advice you’ve got and an advice you want to offer?\nSomething that always made an impression on me happened in school. One of our teachers, a British, had once said that the purpose of education is not to teach you the subjects and make you very good at them. The purpose of education is to instill in you the inquisitive Greek spirit, which means you should keep questioning everything. On the way of life, there is something to learn from the Gita. Don’t let yourself be stressed by events you can’t control and change. Learn to accept them and do your best.\n\nRC Bhargava, former CEO and current chairman of Maruti Suzuki, takes questions on a range of issues, from how the carmaker stayed on top and how he looks at future challenges.

Now BJP is demanding his resignation for violating the constitutional decorum of the post. Recently, Jharkhand Assembly Speaker, Rabindra Nath Mahto, had accused Raj Bhavan of working at the “behest of BJP” by blocking crucial bills passed by the State Government in the State Assembly.

A week earlier, the deficit was over 30%. The most rainfall deficit regions were the southern peninsula, East and North-East regions, and central India.

AHMEDABAD:  Despite Central government’s efforts to expand organic farming across India, such a technique has not found any favour with Gujarat. Land under organic farming has not expanded even by an inch in six years, data reveals.\n\nEvery year, the government announces the budget for organic farming but fails to motivate the state farmers. In Gujarat, around 960,000 hectares are cultivated, with just 32,092.51 hectares being organically cultivated.\n\nAccording to official data, organic farming covered 30,092 hectares in 2014-2015, and it expanded by 2,000 hectares in 2015-2016. Following that, from 2016 to 2022, organic farming land did not rise at all.\nThe Central government launched the ‘Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana’ (PKVY) to promote organic farming. Gujarat has already developed its own organic farming strategy, which appears to have failed to attract farmers to organic farming.\n\nThere are 10,27,865 organic agricultural farmers in the country under PKVY, with Gujarat’s farmer’s name missing. As per a Lok sabha answer on March 21, 2023, the Centre has not released any funds for Gujarat in 2021-22 under the PMKY scheme following slow progress in utilizing PMKY funds. \n\nGujarat Congress spokesperson Parthiv Raj Kathwadia said according to the Lok Sabha reply, Rs 8184.81 crore were released in the country under PKVY during the year 2021-2022, but Gujarat received nil funds in 2021-22. “Not even a single paisa has been spent by the Gujarat government to attract or encourage farmers,” he said.\n\nThe Gujarat Natural Farming and Organic Agricultural University were established six years ago by the state government to guide and divert farmers in Gujarat to organic farming. According to the vice-chancellor of this university, farmers in Gujarat have shifted to natural farming rather than organic.\n\n ",

          "description": "The HC further pointed out that owing to it, female and male children are getting attracted to each other and these attractions are resulting in physical relationship with consent. BHOPAL:  The Madhya Pradesh High Court has requested the central government, to consider reducing the age of consent from 18 years to 16 years under Section 375 IPC (which deals with rape) for “redressing the injustice being caused to adolescent boys.”\n\nWhile quashing a 2020 rape case filed against a 20-year-old youth by a 17-year-old girl, the single judge bench of the HC in Gwalior, headed by Justice Deepak Kumar Agarwal observed on June 27, “This court would like to share its experience as a judge that before amendments in IPC under Section 375 of IPC regarding age of prosecutrix for the purpose of consent that was 16 years and subsequently enhanced by amendment up to 18 years due to this amendment, fabric of society has been disturbed. Nowadays, every male or female near the age of 14 years due to social media awareness and easily accessible internet connectivity is getting puberty in early age.”\n\nThe HC further pointed out that owing to it, female and male children are getting attracted to each other and these attractions are resulting in physical relationships with consent. “In these cases, males are not at all criminals. It is only a matter of age when they come into contact with females and develop physical relationships. Only due to this reason, lawmakers in IPC, when it came into force, put the age of female as 16 years since they were well aware of the aforesaid facts.”\n\n“Generally, girls and boys of adolescent age develop friendship and thereafter, due to attraction make a physical relationship. But, due to this rider boys are treated like criminals in society. Today, in most criminal cases in which the prosecutrix is under 18 years of age, due to the aforementioned anomaly, injustice is going on with adolescent boys. Thus, I request the government to think over the matter for reducing the age of the prosecutrix,” the bench observed. ",

BHOPAL: Two villages of the tribal-dominated Shahdol district of Madhya Pradesh are set to host Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. Of the two, his visit to Baiga-tribe-dominated Pakariya, has ushered some development work in the village.\n\nThe Prime Minister will first address a mega rally in Lalpur village (around 15 km from Shahdol district headquarters), where he will also unveil the launch of the National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission and distribution of one crore Ayushman Bharat cards. Subsequently, he would travel to Pakariya village (7 km from Lalpur village) for an interaction with four tribal groups, before tasting their tribal food.\n\nThe interaction, which will take place on hand-knitted traditional tribal cots in a mango orchard of Pakariya village, will see the PM interact with four tribal groups, including village heads of tribal villages, representatives of successful women SHGs, PESA Committee members and kid and teenage players of Football Kranti (a grass-root football revolution ushered on the lines of West Bengal in 1000 villages of Shahdol, Umaria and Anuppur districts).\n\nThe PM’s visit was initially scheduled for June 27, but got deferred (on June 26) to July 1, owing to the possibility of heavy rains. The visit has boosted development in the Pakariya village, whose 20-strong gram panchayat comprises 13 women members, including the sarpanch and the deputy sarpanch – all of whom had been elected unopposed.\n\nThe village, which till a few days ago only had kutcha road, has been redone with cement and concrete roads that connect it with the Jaitpura-Burhar highway. The village’s electricity supply infrastructure too, has been boosted with a new and high powered transformer, new wire-lines and installation of new electricity meters in many houses – all due to the PM’s visit.\n\nThe same village, which has its women residents running PDS shops and other businesses, also has been ushered in with new water pipelines and water tanks and drinking water taps. Also, the Anganwadi Center in the village has undergone a face lift. “We’ve better road connecting the village to the highway, new electricity wire-line and poles and new drinking water taps in the village. The visit by Modiji has brought in all these facilities to our village. We’ll definitely go to meet and hear him,” said Pagariya residents Mahesh Baiga and Sumitra Baiga.\n\nImportantly, the PM’s visit to the two tribal dominated villages of the region, which predominantly houses Gond, Baiga and Kol tribe population is not only being seen among political quarters as an effort by the BJP to reach out to the tribal groups in Mahakoshal and Vindhya region of BJP-ruled MP, but also to tribes in the Congress-ruled neighbouring Chhattisgarh, which too will hold assembly polls by the end of 2023.

NEW DELHI:  Amid growing buzz that the Centre may table a draft Uniform Civil Code (UCC) during the Monsoon session of Parliament in July, the Uttarakhand UCC panel announced on Friday that it has completed work on the draft UCC for the state and will soon submit it to the government.\n\nThis development comes a day after the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Justice invited representatives of the Law Commission and the law ministry on July 3 to seek views of stakeholders on the issue of UCC.\n\nAddressing the media in the capital, Justice (retd) Ranjana Prakash Desai, who heads the expert committee set up by the state government last year, stated that the panel has drafted the code by taking into account all shades of opinions and considering various statutes and uncodified laws, including the statutory framework in select countries.  \n\nMeanwhile, the Parliamentary panel’s call for consultations on UCC has sparked speculation that the government is considering tabling the bill on UCC during the Monsoon session of Parliament, which will begin in the second week of July. This paper previously reported that during a high-level meeting chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in April, he expressed his keenness to introduce the bill in the Monsoon session of Parliament in July. The meeting was attended by former Law Minister Kiren Rijiju, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, top officials from various departments, BJP President J P Nadda, and RSS Joint General Secretary Arun Kumar, among others.\n\nAccording to the schedule of the standing committee led by BJP Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Modi, representatives of the law panel and legal affairs and legislative departments of the law ministry will be heard “on public notice issued by the Law Commission of India on 14th June 2023, inviting views from the various stakeholders on the Uniform Civil Code, under the subject ‘Review of Personal Laws.”\n\nSushil Modi, speaking to this paper, said that the committee has shared a consultation paper issued by the 21st Law Commission in August 2028 with all its members. He stated, “The committee will deliberate on the previous Law Commission report and will seek views from members on various issues involved.” Congress MP Manickam Tagore, who is a member of the Standing Committee, said that he will present his views on issues involving the proposed UCC in the Monday meeting. Tagore mentioned that the BJP government is bringing up UCC to divert attention from other pressing issues. He said, “In the standing committee meeting, we will be discussing the 2018 consultation paper prepared by the previous commission. We will present our views.”\n\nAfter PM Modi made a strong pitch in favor of uniform laws for people across communities earlier this week, several opposition parties, women’s groups, Muslim bodies, and tribal outfits have come out in opposition to UCC, alleging that the BJP is resorting to ‘divisive politics’ ahead of the 2024 elections. Modi emphasized that the country cannot be run with ‘two laws’ when the Constitution talks about equality for all. The UCC, which falls under Article 44 of the Constitution of India, calls for a common set of laws for all religious communities. ",

          "description": "The Indian automotive industry has operated without any formal planning or inclusion in government policies such as five-year plans. RC Bhargava, former CEO and current chairman of Maruti Suzuki, takes questions on a range of issues, from how the carmaker stayed on top and how he looks at future challenges. Excerpts from 6th edition of Delhi Dialogue, The New Indian Express\n\nThe Indian automotive industry has operated without any formal planning or inclusion in government policies such as five-year plans. It is difficult to believe that a government organisation could handle the pressure of VIP demands and vehicle registrations.\n\nShahid Faridi: Maruti started as a joint venture and it became a private company. How and when did it happen?\nThe government started with the intentions that the foreign company should take 40% equity. At that time, no foreign manufacturer wanted to actually put cash into the company. The other people who were offered to partner with Maruti wanted only to give second-hand equipment, but nobody wanted to invest.\n\nSuzuki, on its own, agreed to take 25% stake. Later they agreed to take 26% when they understood 26% gives them more rights.\n\nThen there was a revision in the contract within five years, and Suzuki was given an option of increasing its stake to 40%. So, they went up to 40% within five years.\n\nThen came 1991 liberalisation and we wanted foreign investments. The PMO told us to persuade Suzuki to increase its equity into Maruti and see if we could get any other foreign investment in the company.\nWe talked to Suzuki and it was decided that they will become equal partners with the government. In 1995, trouble started between the government and Suzuki. When they had become 50-50 partners, they said that the managing director would be the nominee from the partners, alternatively retiring in 1997.\n\nThere was a big difference of opinion on who should be the one. Ultimately, the issue went into an international arbitration. The government changed and Sikander Bakht became the Industries Minister. He realised that there is no way a government could run a car company. There were talks that we wanted Suzuki out but then Bakth negotiated and the court case was settled. He said the government would make money selling the shares. The government first gave Suzuki some shares so that it became the majority partner and the government took a premium of Rs 1,000 crore for giving Suzuki the control that time.\n\nMaruti got listed in 2003 and the government totally sold its shares after 2003-2007. \n\nDipak Mondal: What are the steps the government should take to increase manufacturing sector’s contribution in the GDP?\nFundamentally, the government can’t do much. However, one thing the government must do is to understand the value of time. You know the most costly thing for a big project is time. We are doing this project in Kharkhoda. Our people calculated that each day’s delay would cost us something like Rs 40 crore. In most government places, people are not willing to take decisions. Any project you want to do, you have to take so many approvals. It is one of the most frustrating things. \n\nDipak Mondal: Are you saying not much has changed on the ground?\nState governments decide on clearances. If something is not happening, we blame the Central government. However, all clearances, such as on electricity, water, sewerage, afforestation and the environment, are taken by state governments.\n\nMonika Yadav: What is your assessment of the rural consumption pattern? Do you think India can overtake US and China as a manufacturer in the automobile sector?\nI don’t think we can overtake China, probably not even the US. A major factor that we have to consider is the number of people in India is so large that if I want to get to the US standards, where they have more cars per thousand people, we would have 150 crore cars in India, which makes it impossible in terms of resources. \n\nChina is way ahead of us, especially in terms of infrastructure. Politically in India, it is impossible to do what China does in rebuilding rural infrastructure.\n\nOver the last 10-15 years, we have seen that the focus of growth has shifted from big cities. Given the infrastructure of cities like Delhi, it’s impossible for many more cars to fit into this place. A lot of people in rural areas are buying cars. We had recognised this trend about 10-15 years ago. Over 40% of our  total sales come from rural markets, including small towns.\n\nMonika Yadav: About artificial intelligence, do you think driverless cars are the future?\nThere are two aspects of it in India. One, it doesn’t make sense because we have so much unemployment, and drivers are a major source of employment. If you are selling 4 million cars, you are probably generating 7-8 lakh driver jobs every year. The other is a purely technical reason. For AI to grow, some degree of predictability is needed with some data. I don’t think any technologist today can predict the Indian behaviour.\n\nRakesh Kumar: What is your view on the semiconductor ecosystem in India?\nThe situation is improving. From what one is reading, following the PM’s recent visit to the US, is that there’s going to be more movement in that area in India. I think the chipmakers are recognising that the future growth market is India. \n\nNeha Periwal: Why Japanese, why not Germans?\nGermans, to some extent, are similar in a sense that they have a much higher involvement of employees in their companies. However, they haven’t managed to do what the Japanese have. And the cost is much higher. When we went for a partnership at that time, Volkswagen was interested. They even offered us a car, not the kind of a small car that Japan was using. Europe wasn’t using small cars. But then, they changed their mind. They thought India wasn’t a good market. Why Suzuki agreed to enter India, I have no idea.\n\nAmit Mukherjee: Do you think Maruti is late in entering the EV market?\nI don’t think that we are late in this (EV segment) market. \n\nWe had developed an electric car a few years ago. WagonR was converted, but the cost was too high. The Indian market is a much more price sensitive. Our Per Capita GDP is $2000 or so; Europe’s is $45,000. The cost of electric cars was not low at that time; the battery cost was quite high. The other big issue is that the major component of the car is the battery. Nobody is making batteries in India. And there was a lot of talk about battery technology. \n\nEven now, nobody is sure whether lithium ion batteries will be able to continue for five years from now. Who is going to invest in battery manufacturing? Then there is uncertainty behind the technology of batteries. You invest in a factory, the battery gets obsolete; you are stuck.\n\nPrabhu Chawla: You are shifting to EVs because of environmental concerns. Similar to the scrappage policy of petrol and diesel cars, would the EVs also be scrapped after 10 years?\nWe are introducing EVs correctly to improve the environment, and get nearer to carbon neutrality. The question is until we change the composition from predominantly coal-fired to renewable clean energy sources, are we really reducing the carbon footprint?\n\nA car should be scrapped if it fails to meet the environmental and safety standards.\n\nThis means there has to be periodical checking of fitness. We don’t have the infrastructure to do it. \n\nJitendra Choubey: Is there a dilemma in the industry whether we should go for EV or hydrogen?\nThe use of hydrogen on a commercial scale is not possible. You need big infrastructure and safety measures. In India, we have other options — created by a large agricultural, human and cattle waste — which offer you the possibility of compressed biogas and ethanol.\nWe look at hydrogen and electricity because the West is doing it. The West doesn’t have these options of cattle dung and agricultural waste. \n\nKetan Tanna: What is the future of affordable cars? \nIt is a tricky issue. We do need to provide cars that meet the best safety standards. But safety standards mean cost. Small cars become less affordable than big cars because the percentage increase in the price of the car is much higher, when the car itself is low-cost. Airbags in small cars and airbags for a big car don’t make much difference. However, if you put an airbag in a car costing Rs 50 lakh and you put it in a car costing five lakh, there’s a big difference in the impact. Thus, small cars have become less affordable. Therefore, their sales have more or less stagnated.\n\nWhat is the answer? One is that you reduce taxes on small cars. I’ve been saying that taxes on cars in India are the highest in the world. Europe has a VAT maximum of 19%, Japan has about 10% and the US has something similar to that. Our small cars go at about 29-30% and the big cars at 45%. \n\nArshad Khan: Carmakers are leaving India.\nHow many carmakers are there in the US, how many in Japan? How many do we have in India? How do you make them all viable? How can they all be profitable? The simple thing is India has partnered with carmakers. Many of them just didn’t make the cut. They have to fall out. We can’t support so many carmakers. \n\nArshad Khan: On Tesla…\nTesla is welcome as long as they work on the same basis of all other carmakers. People should have freedom to exit, and enter. Tesla has asked for some tax concessions earlier. They had said that they should be allowed to import cars at lower duties to test the market. So why should they be allowed to import cars at lower duty when nobody else is allowed to import? Now they’re not asking for that.\n\nNeha Periwal: What is the best advice you’ve got and an advice you want to offer?\nSomething that always made an impression on me happened in school. One of our teachers, a British, had once said that the purpose of education is not to teach you the subjects and make you very good at them. The purpose of education is to instill in you the inquisitive Greek spirit, which means you should keep questioning everything. On the way of life, there is something to learn from the Gita. Don’t let yourself be stressed by events you can’t control and change. Learn to accept them and do your best.\n\nRC Bhargava, former CEO and current chairman of Maruti Suzuki, takes questions on a range of issues, from how the carmaker stayed on top and how he looks at future challenges.

The authors found that shifting resources away from development expenditure to benefit a smaller group of privileged retired public sector employees would worsen inequality and impede economic growth. The paper suggested that the long-term economic viability of public pension programs in India should be considered by the next Finance Commission. It also recommended that NITI Aayog create a knowledge sharing platform to improve administrative efficiency among states.",

          "description": "Chinese Premier Xi Jinping has confirmed his participation and will also make some remarks, according to Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Hua Chunying. NEW DELHI: President Putin along with other SCO leaders Chinese Premier Xi Jinping and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif are expected to attend the SCO summit 2023 virtually on July 4th.\n\nPutin was all set to travel to Delhi to attend the summit in person. However, when Delhi announced on May 30th that the summit would be virtual he had to change his plans. Putin is also expected to address the summit.\n\nThis will be the 23rd meeting of the SCO leaders. \n\n\"For the upcoming SCO summit, under India’s ongoing chairmanship, we had earlier agreed upon some mutually agreeable dates and had planned the trip of President Putin to attend it in person in Delhi. However, the Indian side decided to make it virtual and we confirmed participation for that too as we attach priority to SCO,’’ said Kremlin’s Foreign Policy Advisor, Yuri Ushakov.\n\nChinese Premier Xi Jinping has confirmed his participation and will also make some remarks, according to Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Hua Chunying.\n\nPakistan’s Foreign Ministry, too has confirmed the participation of PM Sharif.\n\n\"PM Sharif’s participation illustrates the high importance that Pakistan attaches to the SCO as an important forum for regional security and prosperity and enhanced engagement in the region,’’ according to Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry.\n\nMeanwhile, most members of the SCO are disappointed with the summit being converted into a virtual event as they were all gearing up for the event.\n\n“We had been looking forward to our leaders meeting in person until we heard that the summit would now be virtual. Since December 2022, we were gearing up for the event and stopped in our tracks when the announcement to host the event virtually was made in May,” said a representative of an SCO member country.\n\nIndia took the chairmanship of the SCO from Uzbekistan after the conclusion of the SCO Summit in Samarkand in September 2022. After hosting nearly 134 meetings in person, the Ministry of External Affairs announced on May 30 that the summit would be held virtually on July 4.\n\n“India has been too consumed by the G20 Presidency and the events revolving around it, as a result of which the events under the SCO chairmanship have been lost. The only time SCO came into prominence briefly was during the SCO foreign ministers’ meet in Goa,” said another member.\n\nThe SCO grouping is by no means insignificant if one was to consider the geographic scope and population. “It is the world’s largest regional organisation in terms of area, covering approximately 60 per cent of Eurasia and 40 per cent of the world population, with a combined GDP of 20 per cent of the global GDP. So, it is only natural for us to have expected it to be more visible,” lamented another SCO member.\n\nThe members of the SCO include India, Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Pakistan. Iran is likely to become a member this year. The SCO also has dialogue partners that include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Turkey. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt are also expected to be dialogue partners. ",

It cannot be done in a day or two, it is going to be a time-consuming process,” he said, adding that the PM’s pitch for UCC in Bhopal has nothing to do with the panel’s work.\n\nThe decision on UCC was taken by the Law Commission after taking into consideration the relevance and importance of UCC and the various court orders pertaining to it. Speaking to this paper, Sushil Kumar Modi, chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice, said, “The meeting is being called to understand the issues involved regarding the UCC and to discuss the consultation paper issued by the 21st Law Commission on August 31, 2018.”\n\nAccording to sources, Awasthi will not attend the meeting. Another member of the Law Commission would attend the meeting on his behalf, they said. “The 21st Law Commission did not make any consultation paper on the creation of UCC. Their work suggested amendments in the existing personal laws on a few subjects such as marriage, divorce and inheritance, among others. They also highlighted disparities in various family laws,” he said.\n\nThe 21st Law Commission, in its 2018 consultation paper, had suggested that UCC was “neither necessary nor desirable at this stage”. It said that amendments should be made to family laws of various religions to make them gender-just. It also said that women must be guaranteed their freedom of faith without any compromise on their right to equality. ",

BENGALURU:  The country’s largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Thursday at its annual general meeting informed shareholders that it has banned six employees and six business associate firms and an investigation is going on with three more employees.\n\nFor the first time, the company mentioned on record the banning of six employees with regard to the alleged jobs-for-bribe scam at the company.  Earlier, in a BSE filing, it had said no key managerial person of the company has been found to be involved.\n\nTCS Chairman N Chandrasekaran said the company received two whistleblower complaints (one related to India, and another one related to US) towards February-end and March-end and both the complaints were investigated. “The complaints were about certain favouritism being done and favours being received in recruitment of BAs (business associates),” he said.\n\nHe explained that the company has two departments -- one is the HR and talent acquisition, which hires people, and the second  one is the Resource Allocation Group (RAG), which is about deployment of the available resources into projects. “Whenever there is a talent shortage or a particular skill that is not available at that point in time in the location where we need them, the company has a set of, we call them business associate firms, the firms to get contract employees,” he added.\n\n“At any point in time in the overall deployment of resources, about 2-3% are such BA associates or contractors. And this complaint was related to certain individuals in the company working with certain BA firms to be recruiting in their favour,” he informed.\n\nChandrasekaran also said that the investigation in India is done by a senior officer in the company and in the US market, they had an external firm to do that. He said they found six employees did not follow the ethical conduct. “While we cannot quantify what favours they got, they certainly behaved in a way that they were favouring certain firms,” he said.

Letter petitions and public interest litigations can also be heard by the second and third benches, which would now be headed by Justices SK Kaul and Sanjiv Khanna respectively, subject to the same being assigned by the CJI.\n\nApart from this, a new process will also be followed from July 3 for listing and mentioning of fresh cases.

          "description": "In light of the recent mercenary rebellion in Russia, Security Council Secretary, Nikolai Patrushev appraised NSA Doval of the situation and also sought possible solutions. NEW DELHI:  Russia’s Security Council Secretary, Nikolai Patrushev, spoke with India’s National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval on Wednesday and briefed him about the latest developments in his country. This comes close on the heels of a short-lived mercenary rebellion that shook the Kremlin earlier this week.\n\n“The current issues of Russian-Indian cooperation in the field of security and the prospects for their deepening within the framework of bilateral and multilateral formats were discussed in detail,” according to a statement issued by the Russian government.\n\nPatrushev and Doval had met in person on March 29 on the sidelines of the SCO National Security Advisors meet in Delhi. The two had discussed cooperation between India and Russia in the area of security.\n\nIn light of the recent rebellion that shook Russia, Patrushev would have reached out to Doval to not only apprise him of the situation in Russia but also seek possible solutions. It may be recalled that Doval had also met President Putin in person in Moscow in February at a meeting on Afghanistan.\n\nThe rebellion by Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner group on June 24, Saturday, had posed a serious challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin — a probable first in more than two decades — raising questions about his dwindling control and leadership.\n\nThe Wagner mercenary group had taken control of Russia’s Rostov-on-Don town. The revolt ended when Prigozhin decided to stop in his tracks and made a deal with the Kremlin. The mercenary chief will now relocate to Belarus.\n\nInterestingly, until now the Wagner Group had been a key piece of Russia’s strategy in Ukraine, with the group’s forces being deployed to hold cities such as Bakhmut. The tension between Russia’s defence ministry and Wagner Group escalated dramatically on June 23 (Friday), when Prigozhin accused Russian forces of attacking their camps in eastern Ukraine, which resulted in some casualties. \n\nThis angered Prigozhin, who indicated through a video message that same evening his intent to rebel.\nThereafter, Wagner forces left Ukraine and marched into Russia on Saturday, taking control of the Russian military headquarters for the southern region in Rostov-on-Don, which has been overseeing the fight in Ukraine. President Putin called the uprising “a stab in the back” through a televised address on Saturday.\n“All those who prepared the rebellion will suffer inevitable punishment,” Putin said, “The armed forces and other government agencies have received the necessary orders.”\n\nThough a full-fledged rebellion was averted, the incident laid bare chinks in the Russian establishment, which the Kremlin wants to cover. They are not just looking at enhancing their security within Russia but also seeking help from its ally India to help them counter anything similar in the future, said an expert on India-Russia relations.\n\nThe Wagner Group is actually a group of entities that operate as a Private Military Company (PMC). These PMCs can be hired by governments for security or combat services and are common in war zones. The United States too had a private military during its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, there are some structural differences in how they are used in different parts of the world.\n\nSecurity a continuous dialogue\nAjit Doval and Nikolai Patrushev had met on March 29 on the sidelines of the SCO National Security Advisors’ meet in Delhi. The two had discussed cooperation between both the nations in the area of security. In light of the recent mercenary rebellion in Russia, Patrushev appraised Doval of the situation and also sought possible solutions. Doval had also met President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last February at a meeting on Afghanisthan. ",

The state poll panel also said the number of valid nominations is also much higher this time.\n\nThe SEC submitted the affidavit following a directive of the high court that was issued while hearing a petition of Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari accusing the ruling Trinamool Congress of forcing the opposition candidates to withdraw their nominations.\n\nIn the affidavit, the SEC said 9.03 per cent of valid nominations were withdrawn in this year’s Panchayat elections while the figure was 17.65 per cent in the previous polls.

In the 2018 assembly elections, the party secured only one seat out of 19 in the districts of the eastern division. In Yamunanagar, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh hit out at Rahul Gandhi over his “market of hate” (nafrat ka bazaar) remarks.\n\n“The so-called ‘shop of love’ (mohabbat ki dukan) is not needed” because where is hate?” Singh asked.\nWhile addressing Gauravshali Bharat rally in Yamunanagar on the completion of nine years of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, Rajnath Singh said whether it was Ram temple in Ayodhya or abrogation of Article 370 in J&K, whatever the BJP promised, it has delivered.

LUCKNOW: Four members of the Kashi royal family have been booked over the alleged theft of some items from Ramnagar Fort.\n\nThe FIR was registered at Ramnagar police station on June 25 on a complaint filed by security personnel Rajesh Kumar Sharma deployed at the fort.\n\nAccording to the complainant, four members of the royal family of Kashi Narsh Dr Vibhuti Narayan Singh made way with a bed, some furniture and some important documents from the fort.\n\nThe four named as accused in the FIR are Rajkumari Vishnu Priya and Rajkumari Krishna Priya – both sisters of Maharaj Anant Narayan Singh, who is the son of erstwhile king of Kashi Vibhuti Narayan Singh and currently in charge of the fort.\n\nThe security guard, in his complaint, also submitted to the police that on the morning of June 25, between 9 am and 10 am, he was told by a worker Kaushalendra Sharma at the fort that the lock of a room belonging to Nanat Narayan Singh on Deodhi Kot side was broken.\n\n“Important documents, furniture, and bed were reported missing. When I inquired into the matter, I found that Rajkumari Vishnu Priya, Rajkumari Krishna Priya, Varad Narayan Singh and Ballabh Narayan Singh and their employees, who reside in the fort, stole the items after breaking open the lock of the door.”\n\nConsequently, on the basis of the complaint, police lodged an FIR under Sections 380 (theft in dwelling house), 454 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking in order to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nAs per the local sources, the theft case found its genesis in a property dispute among the royal family members including the three princesses Vishnu Priya, Hari Priya and Krishna Priya and Kunwar Anant Narayan Singh.\n\nThe sources claimed that when the police reached the fort on Tuesday for investigation, Kunwar Anant Narayan Singh said that the sisters were staying in the fort.\n\nKashi Naresh Dr Vibhuti Narayan Singh had given immovable property to all three sisters at the time of their marriage. After the death of Kashi Naresh, the sisters started litigation over the property in 2005. As per the police sources, during the investigation, the youngest princess Krishna Priya told the police authorities that some employees of the fort were conspiring against them to create a split among the siblings.\n\n“How can we steal something from our own house?” wondered Krishna Priya.\n\nRamnagar Fort is a historical monument and the members of the former royal family still reside there.    Tourists come in large numbers to see the fort. For the past several years, there has been a dispute between the three princesses and Kunwar Anant Narayan Singh over the property inside and outside the fort. ",

NEW DELHI: All panchayats across the country will mandatorily use digital payments for all development work and revenue collection this Independence Day onwards, and will be declared UPI-enabled, a letter issued by the Panchayati Raj Ministry said.\n\nStates should \"announce and inaugurate\" the UPI-compliant panchayats in the presence of prominent dignitaries, like chief ministers, MPs, and MLAs, the ministry said in the letter to states and Union territories.\n\nSecretary of Panchayati Raj Ministry, Sunil Kumar said almost 98 per cent of panchayats have already started using UPI-based payments.\n\n\"Payments worth almost Rs 1.5 lakh crore have been made through the Public Financial Management System (PMFS). Payments to panchayats will now be made digitally. Payments in cheques and cash have almost been stopped,\" Kumar said.\n\n\"It has almost universal coverage now. We have already covered almost 98 per cent of panchayats,\" he said.\n\nPanchayats have also been asked to hold meetings with service providers and vendors on June 30.\n\nA list with details of contact persons from UPI platforms GPay, PhonePay, Paytm, BHIM, Mobikwik, WhatsApp Pay, Amazon Pay and Bharat Pe has been shared by the ministry. By July 15, panchayats have to choose appropriate service providers and finalise vendors by July 30, as per guidelines by the ministry.\n\nPanchayats have also been asked to choose a single vendor which covers the whole area so as to allow economies of scale.\n\nIt has also been recommended to create a centralised dashboard for monitoring transactions in real-time. Training camps will be held at the district and block levels for officials.\n\nMinister of State for Panchayati Raj Kapil Moreshwar Patil said enabling digital transactions will help in checking corruption.\n\n\"Most panchayats are now using digital payments. It will help in checking corruption. From planning to payment, everything is happening digitally,\" Patil said.\n\nAccording to government data, 806.3 crore transactions worth Rs 12.98 lakh crore were made through BHIM in January 2023 alone.\n\nThe contribution of rural and peri-urban areas in digital transactions is around 50 per cent.\n\nPanchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) are making digital payments through the PFMS-eGram Swaraj interface, and over 90 per cent of PRIs have been audited online, according to the ministry.

Giriraj claimed Nitish was hopeful of being declared as the convener of the alliance of Opposition parties, but it could not happen; thus, Kumar remained a bachelor. Opposition leaders had met in the state capital on June 23, declaring that they would fight the LS election against BJP together. Giriraj said it was not the first time Nitish remained a ‘bachelor’.

His remark came only a few days after the opposition leaders from across the country assembled in the state capital and decided to contest LS polls against BJP together. PK claimed that chief minister Nitish Kumar had joined the grand alliance with planning. He said, “In 2015, I had formed the grand alliance in Bihar, so I know what will be the future of this alliance.” PK said that since the 2020 assembly elections, Nitish knew it would not be possible for him to remain CM for a long time.\n\nCollapse of another bridge sparks row\nA fresh controversy erupted over the collapse of another bridge over the Ganga in Vaishali district. The pontoon bridge built at a cost of Rs 10 crore collapsed after a strong wind ripped through the district. People remained stranded on the bridge as a portion was washed away due to strong wind. The bridge connecting Raghopur to Vaishali district headquarters was the only means of transportation for people living in the riverine belt of Raghopur, the assembly constituency of Deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav.

It will hurt the sentiments of lakhs of Muslims of the valley and outside and presents a poor reflection on the state of affairs in J&K,” the Anjuman spokesman said.\n\nThe Eid prayers have not been held at the Eidgah, which is a sensitive downtown locality, since the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A by the centre on August 5, 2019.

JAIPUR:  Raising the BJP pitch in Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot’s turf in poll-bound Rajasthan, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said the world now listens attentively to what India says as its stature has risen in the past nine years. The Defence Minister was speaking at a public rally in Balesar town of Rajasthan’s Jodhpur district.\n\n“The whole world is looking towards India as the country’s position has strengthened manifold,” he said. Rajnath also highlighted the works and schemes undertaken in the last nine years of the Modi government.\n\nThe huge gathering was organised in the Shergarh Assembly constituency area in Balesar which is a Rajput-dominated area. The visit was an attempt to tap the Rajput votes as the BJP seeks to improve its prospects in the Marwar region of west Rajasthan.\n\nThis is the political turf where CM Ashok Gehlot has dominated for the past three decades as Jodhpur is his hometown. Highlighting PM Modi’s achievements, Singh emphasized that Modi’s leadership has transformed India’s global standing.\n\nThe Defence Minister asserted that the BJP fulfils all promises it makes, whether it is the abrogation of Article 370 or the construction of a grand Ram temple. The BJP has not yet declared a chief ministerial (CM) face for this Assembly polls due in a few months.\n\nIn the past four elections, Vasundhara Raje has been the face of the party in Rajasthan, but this time, the party has taken a different approach.\n\nSources indicate that the party intends to contest the election based on PM Modi’s popularity. As a result, several party leaders are expected to visit the state in the coming days.\n\nContinuing the series of BJP’s prominent leaders addressing public gatherings, BJP chief JP Nadda will hold a meeting in Bharatpur on June 29. Nadda will also inaugurate the new party office building in Bharatpur and hold a meeting with district office-bearers.\n\nThe next day, on Friday, Union Minister Amit Shah will also visit Rajasthan. He will address a big rally in Udaipur. The BJP is likely to release a report card of the Modi government. ",

He also directed the authorities to accelerate the pace of work and complete it on time. The Rajendra Mandapam hosts swearing-in ceremonies.\n\nNitish is expected to expand his cabinet before July 10 when the monsoon session of the state assembly begins. The swearing-in of new ministers will be held at Raj Bhawan and so it is necessary that repair work should be completed before July 10, sources said. Soon after Nitish left Raj Bhawan, former Bihar deputy chief minister and BJP MP Modi reached Raj Bhawan and met the governor.\n\nAlthough it is not known what transpired at the meeting between the governor and Modi, the BJP leader said that it was only a coincidence that he met the governor soon after Nitish. “No political meaning should be attached to it”, he added. Modi said that it was merely a courtesy visit as both he and the governor were members of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad.\n\nHe said he met the governor to congratulate him for running state universities’ affairs in a better manner. Both leaders held meetings with the governor for around 30 minutes each. Modi expressed his displeasure over the change in the domicile policy of the state government to make candidates from outside the state eligible for their appointment as teachers in government schools.\n\nThe speculation over yet another political realignment rose as it was initially rumoured that both Nitish and Modi were together at Raj Bhawan, which turned out to be false later. In Bihar, cabinet expansion is long overdue as two ministers from RJD, Kartikeya Kumar and Sudhakar Singh resigned from their posts. The Congress has also been insisting on more ministerial berths.

NEW DELHI:  The Union Cabinet on Wednesday took a raft of decisions to incentivise states to promote sustainable agriculture, including organic farming and alternative fertilisers while extending the urea subsidy scheme for three years. \n\nCalled PM PRANAM (PM Programme for Restoration, Awareness Generation, Nourishment, and Amelioration of Mother-Earth), the schemes include promoting natural and organic farming, alternative fertilisers, nano fertilisers and bio fertilisers to restore soil fertility. The proposals approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs have a total outlay of Rs 3.7 lakh crore, most of which is for urea subsidy. \n\n\n\n“It is crucial to return to more natural farming methods and promote a balanced and sustainable use of chemical fertilisers,” Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said. PM PRAMAN was among the policy announcements made in the general budget in February.\n\nSuppose a state uses 10 lakh tonnes of conventional fertiliser. If it reduces its consumption by 3 lakh tonnes, then the subsidy saving would be Rs 3,000 crore.

NEW DELHI: Amidst deliberations over mandatory usage of precast concrete elements in national highway projects, the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has started pushing developers to employ construction components produced in controlled factory environments. \n\nThe ministry, through an office memorandum, recently made attempts to persuade construction companies involved in the development of the national highways in this regard, saying that it will help all stakeholders in the long run. \n\nThe ministry, on April 1 this year, decided to mandatorily use 25 per cent factory-manufactured concrete elements, out of the total volume, other than the foundation work in projects initiated within a 100 km radius of the precast concrete factory. The aim was a reduction of pollution at construction sites, rapid progress and improved aesthetics. \n\nSpeaking at the National Conference for Civil Engineers and Professionals from Allied Industries in August, Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari reiterated that the government wanted to make precast mandatory at least in Road under Bridges and Road over Bridges.\n\nAlong with the memo issued on Thursday, the ministry has also circulated among the agencies carrying out highway development a two-page note on the benefits of industrialised precast concrete elements.\n\n“Precast concrete has the benefits of all-weather and fast construction, reliable quality and enhanced performance durability, aesthetics due to uniformity in appearance, minimum construction time, reduced carbon emission, and reduced noise and air pollution due to reduced construction activities at the site. To add to that, it will also play an integral role in accelerating the growth of the MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) sector,” read the memorandum sent to all senior officials of the ministry, National Highways Authority of India, National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited and the National Highway Builders Federation. \n\nThe ministry also wants construction companies to develop their own benchmark for the “wider adoption” of precast concrete. “Mandatory use of industrialised precast elements in National Highway (NH) projects is under consideration of the government. The construction firms working on NH projects are however encouraged to use industrialised precast concrete elements in their projects, considering the benefits.\n\nThis will in the long run be beneficial to all stakeholders,” stated the note. At present, precast concrete elements are being used in the construction of the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway. Last month, the ministry sought feedback from stakeholders on the proposed amendments for the implementation of the policy.\n\nReady-to-use concrete has multiple benefits\n\nPrecast concrete has the benefits of all-weather and fast construction, reliable quality and enhanced performance durability, aesthetics due to uniformity in appearance, minimum construction time, reduced carbon emission, and reduced noise and air pollution due to reduced construction activities at the site. To add to that, it will also play an integral role in accelerating the growth of MSMEs, the Ministry of Road Transport said in a note. ",

          "description": "Five crore sugarcane growers to gain from the highest-ever fair and remunerative price for the October-September season.\n  NEW DELHI:  In a move that aims to benefit over 5 crore sugarcane growers, the government on Wednesday approved the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of Rs 315 per quintal for a basic recovery rate of 10.25% for the 2023-24 season (October- September). This is the highest FRP that the farmers have ever got.\n\nAnnouncing the decision taken at the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, Union Minister Anurag Singh Thakur said, “It has also been approved to provide a premium of Rs 3.07 per quintal for each 0.1% increase in recovery over and above 10.25%, and reduction in FRP by Rs 3.07 per quintal for every 0.1% decrease in recovery.”\n\nFurther, with a view to protecting the interest of sugarcane farmers, the government has also decided that there shall be no deduction in the case of sugar mills where recovery is below 9.5%. Such farmers will get Rs 291.975 per quintal for sugarcane in the ensuing sugar season of 2023-24, in place of Rs 282.125 per quintal in the current season of 2022-23.\n\nThe cost of production of sugarcane for 2023-24 is Rs 157 per quintal. This FRP of Rs 315 per quintal at a recovery rate of 10.25% is higher by 100.6% than the production cost. The FRP for 2023-24 is 3.28% higher than the current sugar season.\n\n\n\nThe FRP approved shall be applicable for the purchase of sugarcane from the farmers in 2023-24 (starting October 1, 2023) by sugar mills. Thakur said in the current season, about 3,353 lakh tonnes of sugarcane worth Rs 1,11,366 crore was purchased by sugar mills, which is the second highest, next to the procurement of paddy at the minimum support price.\n\nThe growth of ethanol as a biofuel sector in the last five years has amply supported the sugarcane farmers and sugar sector, as the diversion of sugarcane/sugar to ethanol has led to better financial positions for sugar mills due to faster payments, reduced working capital requirements and reduced blockage of funds due to less surplus sugar with mills, thereby enabling them to make timely payment of cane dues of farmers, Thakur said. \n\nThe Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, also approved a new scheme, PM-PRANAM, to promote alternative fertilisers and reduce the use of chemical ones. It also decided to continue the current urea subsidy scheme for three years ending March 2025, with an outlay of Rs 3.68 lakh crore.\n\nUnion Chemicals and Fertilisers Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said that under the scheme, the states who will adopt alternative fertilisers will be incentivised with the subsidy that is saved by reducing the use of chemical fertilisers. Citing an example, suppose a state is using 10 lakh tonne of conventional fertiliser, and if it reduces its consumption by 3 lakh tonne, then the subsidy saving would be Rs 3,000 crore. Out of that subsidy savings, the Centre will give 50 per cent of it Rs 1,500 crore to the state. ",

          "description": "Aam Aadmi Party’s announcement comes at a time when most opposition parties have come out against the very idea of UCC and show the chinks in opposition unity ahead of the 2024 elections. NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW/CHANDIGARH: A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a fervent pitch for the nationwide implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) extended its ‘in-principle support’ to the UCC while the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and the Shiromani Akali Dal opposed the move and said they will present their views before the Law Commission. \n\nUCC refers to a common set of laws applicable to all citizens regardless of their religion and deals with marriage, inheritance and other personal matters.\n\nThe AAP said while it supports the UCC, the code should be brought in with a consensus after consultations with all stakeholders including political parties and non-political entities.  \n\n“Some issues can’t be reversed in future; some are fundamental issues so it is not correct to adopt an authoritarian approach. There should be consensus. If you implement it without consensus, it will upset and anger a large number of people,” said AAP national general secretary (organisation) Sandeep Pathak. \n\nThe Aam Aadmi Party’s announcement comes at a time when most opposition parties have come out against the very idea of UCC and show the chinks in opposition unity ahead of the 2024 elections.\n\nPM Modi had on Tuesday made a strong push for UCC, asking how the country can function with dual laws that govern personal matters.\n\nReacting to the PM’s viewpoint on the code, the AIMPLB said it will oppose any such plan.\n\n“AIMPLB will oppose the Uniform Civil Code tooth and nail. We are chalking out a strategy to counter the proposed move of the government by presenting our view in front of the Law Commission more powerfully,” said AIMPLB member Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangi Mahali. \n\nThe AIMPLB had called an urgent online meeting late on Tuesday night, where members came to the conclusion that the UCC is neither necessary nor beneficial to the country in any way. Maulana Khalid also questioned the timing of the PM’s announcement ahead of the 2024 general elections. \n\nMeanwhile, the BJP’s former ally Shiromani Akali Dal said rushing the UCC could harm the social fabric and the concept of unity in diversity.\n\n“Not just minority communities, tribal societies that have their own personal laws will also be affected,” said senior SAD leader Daljit Singh Cheema. He said if a clause in a particular personal law is discriminatory, then that may be amended rather than forming a UCC for the entire country.  ",

          "description": "Federalism is not antithetical to national integration. On the contrary, it is a necessary concomitant to the latter. The very first article in the Constitution of India carries a great political philosophy. It says: “India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.” This amalgamation of the states carries the grandeur of federalism. Federalism is not merely a device for the division of power. It encompasses inclusiveness, tolerance, understanding and recognition of the country’s diversity. Federalism is not antithetical to national integration. On the contrary, it is a necessary concomitant to the latter.\n\nThe governments must function independent of the political parties that run them. Having chosen to form a government, the political combination that runs it will be bound by the constitutional prescriptions. If the government identifies with a political ideology, it is the idea of constitutional governance that fails. Unfortunately, this is often the Indian case. As scholar Tarunabh Khaitan observes, there is a kind of fusion between the regime at the Centre and the ruling political party. This, in turn, could also prompt the Centre to treat the states differently.\n\nDifferential treatment of the states can happen in varied ways. The states might get discriminated against in budgetary allocation, extension of aids and reliefs, support for the smooth functioning of the government, etc. The use or abuse of the gubernatorial offices and the selective misuse of the Centre’s probe agencies against those in power in the states also might reflect political agenda.\n\nThere are reports indicating that a great share of the aid from the Union government went to BJP-ruled states whereas the other states were left with lesser funds. This has given rise to grievances not only from the state governments but also from policymakers.\n\nThere is substance in the criticism by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin, who said that the last Union budget was mainly meant for development projects in BJP-ruled states. The chief ministers of West Bengal, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh were critical of the Union budget, for it ignored the legitimate demands of their states. The Delhi government’s criticism of the Centre’s ordinance—which takes away the state government’s jurisdiction over state services—continues to be a serious issue.\n\nAlready there is growing concern over the Centre’s exploitation of the South, leading to inequitable distribution of resources favouring the North. Nilakantan R S explains various facets of the South-North divide in his brilliant work, South vs North: India’s Great Divide. This reveals a geographical disparity in almost all walks of life in the country, which is deeply disturbing.\n\nWhat about the state’s power to avail loans? Kerala finance minister K N Balagopal, in a letter written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, complained that the Ministry of Finance arbitrarily made a reduction of about `4,000 crore in the net borrowing limits of the state. He posed serious constitutional issues based on Article 293(3) of the Constitution. According to this provision, the state should get the Union’s consent for raising any loan if there is any outstanding balance. This does not, however, empower the Union to arbitrarily meddle with the state government’s financial plans which include various welfare schemes for the poor. His criticism was that the Centre was arbitrarily invoking Article 293(3) to control the state’s autonomy in the matter of borrowing.\n\nThe most crucial change in the realm of taxation also favoured the Centre. The 101st Amendment to the Constitution, which designed the Goods and Services Tax—replacing inter alia the then existing state tax—had a centralising effect, as Christophe Jaffrelot opined. It adversely impacted the relative financial autonomy of the states in multiple ways. They struggled to have their voices heard in the GST Council and get their claims for due share accepted. Economic centralisation is clearly a tool for political centralisation.\n\nThe Centre’s differential treatment of the states need not be always based on the political coalition that runs the state. More strikingly, even during the times of human tragedy, the partisan approach has been evident. Take for example the way in which the Centre treated Gujarat in turbulent times as opposed to its approach towards the recent Manipur crisis. True, in the former case, it was Cyclone Biparoy, a natural calamity. In the latter, it was man-made bloodshed. But in both, there was immense human suffering. The Union government can be proud that there were no loss of lives despite the cyclone’s terrible speed of 140 kmph. It carried out intense and effective rehabilitation measures. According to the home minister, about 1,08,208 civilians were moved to safety, 760 babies were delivered under medical care, and 73,000 animals were taken to safer locations.\n\nLet us now come to the tragedy in Manipur. Unlike Gujarat, Manipur is a small state with an area of 22,327 sq km and a population of only 32 lakh. Throughout the horrific clash between the majority Meiteis and the minority Kukis in the state, the Centre has practically remained a mute spectator. Hundreds lost their lives and properties worth crores were damaged. The neglect of the issues in Manipur implies politicisation of the institutions of governance.\n\nThe Centre’s apathy towards Manipur was in total contrast to its commendable vigilance in Gujarat. There was no timely effort to douse the man-made fire in Manipur. The state experienced a situation of lawlessness. During troubled times, a responsible government must see the people as a whole, without making a majority-minority distinction. The government’s paramount duty is to ensure the peaceful co-existence of various communities by preserving the Rule of Law.\n\nThe Gujarat-Manipur contrast is not an accidental irony. In a way, it shows the deeper wounds inflicted upon the nation’s polity. Indian federalism faces multiple and complex challenges, all of which are extremely serious. During the 2024 Lok Sabha election, these federalist concerns may take centre stage in India’s political discourse. Every citizen is entitled to the fruits of constitutional governance, which if denied, would amount to placing party politics above the country. No democracy can afford it.\n\nKaleeswaram Raj\n\nLawyer, Supreme Court of India\n\n(kaleeswaramraj@gmail.com)\n\n(Tweets @KaleeswaramR) ",

          "description": "The judge cited the Supreme Court ruling which held that the appointment of a temple priest is a secular function and hence there is no question of claiming a hereditary right. CHENNAI: The Madras High Court on Monday ruled that caste will have no role in the appointment of archagars (priests) to temples and the only requirement is for the person to be well-versed in the Agamaic principles of the particular temple. \n\n\"At the risk of repetition, it is made abundantly clear that the pedigree based on caste will have no role to play in the appointment of Archaka if the person so selected otherwise satisfies the requirements,” Justice N Anand Venkatesh ruled.\n\nReferring to the challenge to the powers of executive officers (EOs) to appoint the priests, he said it is always left open to the trustees to appoint Archakas/Sthanikam in agamic temples by ensuring the Archakas/Sthanikam are well-versed, properly trained and qualified to perform the pooja as per the requirements under the Agama.\n\nThe petition was filed by Muthu Subramania Gurukkal challenging a 2018 notification for the appointment of archagars/sthanikam to the Sugavaneswarar temple in Salem. He said the notification infringes upon his hereditary rights to hold the position of sthanigam as he was serving in the temple as per customs and usages in line of succession from time immemorial.\n\nDisposing of the writ petition, the court directed the EO to issue a fresh advertisement for appointing the archagar/sthanigam by following due procedures and allowed the petitioner to participate in the selection process.\n\nThe judge cited the Supreme Court ruling which held that the appointment of a temple priest is a secular function and hence there is no question of claiming a hereditary right. However, the archagar is expected to be well-versed in the agamas and rituals necessary to be performed in a temple.\n\n“The Apex Court has also made it very clear that performance of a religious service is an integral part of the religion whereas the Priest or the Archaka performing such service is not so. It differentiated between the religious portion and the secular portion and held that the religious service by an Archaka is the secular part of the religion and the performance of the religious service is an integral part of the religion. \n\nTherefore, the prescription provided by the Agamas gains significance only when it comes to the performance of the religious service. Any person belonging to any caste or creed can be appointed as an Archaka provided he is a well-versed and accomplished person in the particular Agamas and rituals of the temple,” the judge said in the order.

LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government has set up a departmental inquiry against Manzil Saini, an IPS officer of the 2005 batch of UP cadre, following the recommendation of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), in a case related to the murder of an oil trader Shrawan Sahu in 2017.\n\nSaini is currently on deputation in National Security Guard (NSG) as the deputy inspector general. \n\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation had recommended a departmental inquiry against then Lucknow SSP in connection with the high-profile murder case.\n\nHighly placed police sources said that Additional Director General, Intelligence, Bhagwan Swaroop, and Superintendent of Police, Intelligence, Sanjeev Tyagi, will conduct an inquiry against Saini.\n\nSaini was the Lucknow SSP when Shrawan Sahu, an oil mill owner, was murdered at Saadatganj in the old city area on February 1, 2017. Sahu was shot dead while he was pursuing a case against criminal Aquil for his role in the murder of his (Sahu) son Ayush in 2013. The case was transferred to the CBI.\n\nCBI sources said that lapses in providing security cover to Shrawan Sahu despite his repeated requests and threats from criminal Aquil went unheard by Saini as Lucknow SSP.\n\nHowever, CBI sources said that Saini in her reply had cited that the sudden transfer of then district magistrate, approaching elections, lack of police force and preparations of the Republic Day made them all occupied.\n\nThe pending CBI probe against Saini in the case of 2017 eclipsed her prospects for promotion in service while others of her batch were made IG, police. \n\nThe Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court had directed the CBI to probe Shrawan Sahu murder case on March 20, 2017. In May, the same year, the charge sheet was filed, and the trial is underway.\n\nHowever, Saini also holds the unique distinction of being the first woman officer in the history of Uttar Pradesh to take charge as the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of state capital Lucknow in 2016. Before being posted as the SSP of Lucknow, Saini was posted in Etawah, the hometown of Samajwadi Party patriarch, the late Mulayam Singh Yadav.\n\nOther than her alleged inaction in Shrawan Sahu murder case, Saini is known to be an upright officer and had been posted in Badaun, Muzaffarnagar and Mathura. \n\nIPS Saini, who was posted as DIG, NHRC, was appointed DIG, National Security Guard (NSG), under the Ministry of Home Affairs in 2021.\n\nMoreover, Saini is known to have unearthed several high-profile cases, including kidney theft racket case in Moradabad a few months after she got her first posting as SP in 2008.

          "description": "Referring to the stand-off in East Ladakh in 2020, he said, \"The Chinese Army ignored the agreed protocols and unilaterally tried to change the status quo on the LAC.\" NEW DELHI: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday said the situation on the LAC was due to China ignoring the protocols based on which the armies of both countries carried out patrolling.\n\nReferring to the stand-off in East Ladakh in 2020, he said, \"The Chinese Army ignored the agreed protocols and unilaterally tried to change the status quo on the LAC.\" He lauded the valour and dedication of the Indian Army which prevented the attempts by the PLA to change the status quo.\n\nAddressing a ‘National Security Conclave’ in Jammu, he reiterated the government’s stand to resolve the border issue through dialogue and in a peaceful manner. He added that talks are continuing at military and diplomatic levels to resolve the dispute. “We will never let the sanctity of our borders be violated,” he said.\n\nRajnath asserted that India has witnessed a paradigm shift in its security scenario in the last nine years. He said that India’s image in 2013-14 was that of a weak nation which allowed its adversaries to create problems, but today the country has the ability to overcome every threat.\n\n“For a long time, Pakistan has tried to destabilise peace and harmony in the country through cross-border terrorism. However, when we came to power, we launched an effective action against terrorism. We showed the world the meaning of ‘zero tolerance against terrorism’. The bold and first-of-its-kind moves to eliminate terrorists following the Uri and Pulwama incidents are proof of India’s ‘zero tolerance against terrorism’ policy and the unmatched valour of the Armed Forces,” the minister said.\n\nRajnath added that the network of terrorism in Jammu & Kashmir has substantially weakened in the last few years as strict and consistent action is being taken. “Terror funding has been curbed. Supply of arms and drugs to terrorists has been stopped. Along with elimination of terrorists, work is being done to dismantle the network of underground workers,” he said.\n\nALSO READ | Armed UAV deal with the US pending, speculative media reports can impact adversely: MoD\n\nOn PoK, Rajnath said that Pakistan does not have a locus standi as it has illegally occupied the area. The Indian Parliament has unanimously passed at least three resolutions, which state that PoK is a part of India, he said.\n\n“India does not want to depend on imported weapons. Our national security will only be strengthened when we become self-reliant in defence manufacturing. Our aim is to ‘Make in India, Make for the world’. Our efforts are bearing fruit. Today, we are manufacturing tanks, aircraft carriers, submarines and various kinds of weapons. Defence exports have crossed Rs 16,000 crore from a meagre Rs 900 crore before 2014. The exports will soon touch the Rs 20,000 crore mark,” he said.\n\nRajnath underlined the importance of coordination with major world powers, such as the US and Russia, to protect India’s security interests in this globalised world. He stated that India and US are being seen as natural allies and their strategic partnership is being further cemented.\n\nThe minister added that India-US defence cooperation has grown rapidly with the expansion of military-to-military engagements, information sharing and cooperation in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, cyber, space and mutual logistics support. He termed the Prime Minister’s recent visit to the US as a landmark event, which ushered in a new era of bilateral defence cooperation.\n\nRajnath called for an integrated and united response to deal with global threats and challenges. “India is a major regional power. Therefore, it is important for us to align our security concerns with other countries in our extended neighbourhood,” he said. ",

It is not happening like this. It is the conspiracy.” The bill was aimed at ensuring a free telecast of Gurbani from the Golden Temple.  The SGPC has been opposing the bill claiming the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925 can only be amended by Parliament. \n\nCalling SGPC President as Shiromani Akali Dal chief spokesperson, Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann questioned the presence of Dhami at SAD’s meeting. AAP Punjab chief spokesperson Malvinder Singh Kang termed the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee’s rejection to broadcast free Gurbani as unfortunate. He also questioned SGPC President Dhami. ",

LUCKNOW:  The farmers in UP’s sugar bowl — Lakhimpur Kheri — have come up with an interesting way to safeguard their cane crop by playing the scarecrow themselves. In an attempt to save the sugarcane crop, the farmers across a number of villages in Lakhimpur Kheri are spending time in their fields under the guise of a bear to ward off stray animals, especially monkeys. \n\nApart from dressing themselves as a bear, the farmers are also hiring men at Rs 250-Rs 500 to perform the same job. Rajeev Shukla of Bajrang Garh village of Kheri had bought a costume of a bear from adjoining Shahjahanpur for Rs 5,000. “This strategy is working. However, wearing the bear costume is not easy in this sultry weather, but how can I sacrifice my crop and months of labour,” he says.\n\nSome of the farmers are even joined by their wives in the endeavour throughout the day. “We can even charge at the animals straying into our fields as we are covered by the costume,” says Shailendra Singh of Jahan Nagar village.\n\nHowever, the cane farmers of the area are still grappling to find a solution to the problem during the night. “We are protecting the crops during the day time but to keep the stray animals at bay during the night is still a challenge,” says Shailendra Singh.\n\nManoj Tiwari of Fariya Papariya village complains of inaction on the part of the forest department despite repeated petitions. “We have approached the forest officials so many times to reign in the monkeys active in the village but they expressed their inability to tame them owing to lack of funds,” says Tiwari adding that finding no other way to protect the crops, the farmers had to resort to the technique of safeguarding the crops in the guise of bear.\n\nIn some of the villages, the farmers have even prepared a roster and they take turns wearing the bear costume and roaming in the fields. After the pictures of the farmers donning the bear costume went viral, Sanjay Biswal, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Lakhimpur Kheri said, “I assure farmers that we will take measures to stop monkeys from damaging the crops.’ ",

However, civil society organisations termed these FTAs as problematic and they believe such pacts can harm India.\n\nFor instance, India is discussing formally joining the US-led trade bloc Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity.

The Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), an official body of apparel exporters in India, has organised the garment fair. AEPC facilitates Indian exporters, importers, and international buyers who choose India as their preferred sourcing destination for garments.\n\nThe minister noted that the Pradhan Mantri Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM MITRA) Park are being established across seven states of the country with the objective of promoting India’s textile sector in a significant manner. Goyal said PM MITRA Parks will lead to a reduction of logistic costs due to a cluster-based approach to manufacturing and production of quality products with appropriate testing facilities. He emphasised that countrymen deserve the best quality of garments and this should be ensured by all stakeholders.

He said cases against drug peddlers have increased by 181 per cent -- from 1,257 cases between 2006 and 2013 to 3,544 between 2014 and 2022.  \n\nThe minister also said that besides seizures, India has “also launched a destruction campaign to prevent re-use of seized drugs and six lakh kilogrammes of narcotics have been destroyed in the country since June 2022.\n\n“This reflects the Modi government’s commitment for a drug-free India,” Shah said. The home minister said the success against the narcotics trade has been achieved primarily due to the Modi government’s “whole of government” approach under which policies are being framed with close coordination of different wings of the government.     \n\nWhile National Crime Bureau has been constantly keeping a strict vigil to bring down drug smuggling in the region, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) established NCORD in 2019 and Anti-Narcotics Task Force (ANTF) was formed in the police department of every state.

PATNA:  Amid speculations over the expansion of the Nitish cabinet in Bihar, Congress MLC Sameer Kumar Singh on Monday created a flutter in political circles by asserting that his party was entitled to three more ministerial berths.\n\nSingh’s remark has come two days after former Congress president Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of the induction of Congress legislators in the state cabinet with chief minister Nitish Kumar during his visit to the state capital on Friday. Rahul was in Patna to attend the meeting of Opposition leaders on June 23 in which top leaders of 15 non-BJP parties took place to strategise plans against BJP ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha polls.\n\nWhen Rahul inquired from Nitish about the cabinet expansion, CM asked how many Congress legislators had to be made ministers in cabinet expansion. On it, the state Congress president Akhilesh Prasad Singh said that two more legislators had to be elevated to the posts of ministers. Singh said, “Although Congress has the natural claim over three more ministerial berths in the cabinet, as of now discussions are only on two seats.” ",

          "image": "",
          "description": "Books can’t be static, Centre is trying to get them revised as per National Education Policy by next academic session, says Sanjay Kumar, secretary in Education Ministry  Describing the controversy over the rationalisation of NCERT books as “much ado about nothing,” Sanjay Kumar, secretary in the Department of School Education and Literacy in the Education Ministry, tells Kavita Bajeli-Datt that books could not be static and due process was followed before the changes were introduced in the textbooks.\n\nSpeaking on takeaways from the G20 education ministers meeting and learning losses due to Covid-19, he said the ministry is trying to get the new NCERT books revised as per National Education Policy by the next academic session. \n\nExcerpts:\n\nWhat are the major takeaways from the G20 education minister’s meeting?\n\nThe key takeaway for foundational literacy and numeracy is that the G20 countries are facing similar issues. So, you will see a similarity in approach in almost all the countries. The question is to what extent do you have to use technology? It is different for every country. But by and large, everyone’s on the same page that technology has to be used most innovatively. That is the biggest takeaway. The more significant issue is that it’s an excellent opportunity to showcase India. They see the Indian society, our cities, our culture, and our hospitality and the passion we have for development. It is an excellent opportunity to brand India worldwide. The general impression is that everyone is amazed by Indian hospitality. \n\nAt the end of the day, when you return with happy memories of the country, it is also good diplomacy. Most G20 countries are advanced countries. Most of the research is done there. They have some of the best universities. It is an excellent opportunity to partner with them. Ultimately, we are all living in what they say: One Earth, One family, One future. So, the message is clear that we live in an interconnected world. We are also looking at tech-enabled learning.\n\nCovid-19 impacted the education sector severely. Are there any early indicators that we have been able to reach pre-pandemic levels?\n\nWe did a National Achievement Survey (NAS) in November 2020. There are two ways of looking at it. There have been learning losses all across the country in different subjects. But we also found that the learning losses concerning NAS 2017 were not as much as we had expected. It was just a marginal fall. This also shows that whatever we did during the Covid, we reached out to students through the DIKSHA platform, trained the teachers through NISHTHA and launched 12 TV channels.  \n\nWe were able to reach out to children. The learning losses could have been much more acute. So that has been arrested. But there have been learning losses. I guess we are still catching up. We have started VIDYA PRAVESH. This is a three-month play-based school preparation module for Grade-I. Children have skipped an entire class. When the schools reopened, a person in class II found himself in class IV. Most states started a brief catch-up course for all the students. But I think it is going to take a little while. It isn’t easy to quantify how much time it will take. But it may take a year or two to catch up.\n\nThere has been a huge controversy about the rationalisation of NCERT books. Your comments?\n\nI think it is much ado about nothing. You see, during the Covid times, we decided to reduce the course curriculum burden on the children. NCERT deleted some chapters. The new National Curriculum Framework (NCF) is in the making. And once it comes up, all textbooks from pre-primary to class 12 will be reconstructed. We also must look at how knowledge changes with time. Many things change. Books also cannot be static. There may be differences of opinion on what has been dropped and what has been added. There is a certain process that is followed in the NCERT. Expert committees sit, deliberate, and based on their knowledge and expertise; they make specific recommendations about the books. So, NCERT takes decisions accordingly. The process was duly followed.\n\nThe political science textbook committee members have written to NCERT about dropping their \nnames from the books. What do you have to say about this controversy? \n\nThey are entitled to their point of view. But I think the copyright of the books lies with the NCERT. Those committees are not in existence. They had been when the books were made. There is a certain process of adding or subtracting course content in our books. That has been followed. Some things have changed. We all come from different backgrounds. We may agree or disagree, but that is the essence of democracy. NCERT has made some deletions while rationalising the syllabus during the pandemic that the NCERT did not notify, like the portion on RSS, Gandhi and Gujarat riots. Those portions have gone through the process of the expert committee. If there is anything specific, then we can check and come back.\n\nHundreds of scientists have expressed concern over removing topics like the theory of evolution and the periodic table from tenth-grade textbooks. Your comments?\n\nAs I have said earlier, some course correction was done to reduce the load during Covid-19. It was a temporary reduction in the course curriculum. The new books will be out shortly.\n\nWhen will the newly revised books based on National Education Policy (NEP) be rolled out? It was said that the new books would be rolled out by the 2024-25 academic year.\n\nWe’re working on it. We would want the books to come. But then we are also mindful that the quality of the books must not be compromised in any manner. We are also aware of the fact that we must get it right the very first time. If you are in the market and you go to buy books, you will get the first edition, second edition and third edition. So knowledge is something that is continually growing. Books are also continuously evolving, just like us. I am not a futurologist. But we are trying that in the next academic session; we must get as many books as possible. \n\nWe have made plans for how to roll out the books. We are waiting for the national curriculum framework (NCF) to be announced. The NCF is on track. We do hope that it will come out very shortly. Shortly means that it will come out in a couple of months.\n  ",

          "description": "However, in its reply to the Rajya Sabha secretariat dated May 25, 2023, the Home Ministry simply quoted Section 4(3) of the Act. NEW DELHI: Nine months after a parliamentary panel on official language submitted its recommendations to President Droupadi Murmu regarding Hindi and native languages as a medium of instruction in central universities, Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar directed the Union Home Ministry to clear the air on the committee’s mandate. \n\nThe instruction came after CPM Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas wrote to Dhankhar seeking clarification on whether the committee’s power regarding the medium of instruction in universities and professional institutions is beyond the purview of the Official Language Act, 1963. However, in its reply to the Rajya Sabha secretariat dated May 25, 2023, the Home Ministry simply quoted Section 4(3) of the Act.\n\n“It shall be the duty of the Committee to review the progress made in the use of Hindi for the official purposes of the Union and submit a report to the President,” it stated. “The Hon’ble MP in his letter addressed to the Hon’ble Chairman of the Rajya Sabha has raised the query that ‘whether the recent recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee regarding the medium of instruction in Universities and professional institutions is ultra vires of the Act (Official Languages Act, 1963),” said the ministry.\n\nSpeaking to this newspaper, Brittas said that it was clear from the ministry’s response that recommending the medium of instruction to higher educational institutions doesn’t come under its purview and its mandate is only to review the progress made in the use of Hindi for the official purposes of the Union. \n\n“I was constrained to take up the issue with the V-P after failing to get a satisfactory response in Parliament on the ambit of the Official Language Committee. Now, the government has implicitly stated that it’s not within the remit of the committee to dwell on the medium of instruction in educational institutions. And this could be one reason why the report hasn’t been made public so far,” he said. \n\nAlong with the attached response from the Home Ministry, Brittas received the letter from the Rajya Sabha Secretariat on June 22 with the subject line “Misleading reply to unstarred Question 52 given in the Rajya Sabha on 7th December 2022, regarding Committee of Parliament on Official Language & Official Languages Act, 1963.”\n\nA row erupted in October last year after the official Language panel headed by Home Minister Amit Shah recommended the usage of Hindi as a medium of instruction in technical and non-technical institutions, including Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in Hindi-speaking states and respective native languages in other parts of the country. \n\nThe move was vehemently opposed by the chief ministers of Tamil Nadu and Kerala and other opposition-ruled states, as they allege that it’s an attempt to impose Hindi in non-Hindi speaking states. The Committee of Parliament on Official Language was set up in 1976 under Section 4(1) of the Official Languages Act. The Ministry, in its response, further said that it cannot comment on the recommendations of the Committee as it has been placed for the President’s perusal and is under her consideration.\n\n“These recommendations have not been made public. Since the recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee are neither in the public domain nor available to this department. Hence, no comments thereon can be made at present,” it said.\n\nIn a written reply to John Brittas on December 7 in Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Home Affairs, Ajay Kumar Mishra said, “provision regarding the medium of instruction in educational institutions is stipulated in the National Education Policy (2020) which envisages imparting more programs in higher education, using mother tongue/ local language as a medium of instruction, and/or offers programs bilingually.\n\n‘Not under purview’\n\n“It was clear from the home ministry’s response that recommending the medium of instruction to higher educational institutions doesn’t come under its purview and its mandate is only to review the progress made in the use of Hindi for the official purposes of the Union. I was constrained to take up the issue with V-P after failing to get a satisfactory response on the ambit of the Official Language Committee. Now, the government has stated that it’s not within the remit of the committee to dwell on the medium of instruction.” ",

It is reported that Siddiqui has been trolled online for posing a question to Modi in his joint press conference with US President Joe Biden.\n\n“This harassment was completely unacceptable and antithetical to the very principles of democracy that were on display last week during PM Modi’s State visit,’’ said US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby on Monday. Siddiqui had raised a question on the rights of minorities in India to Modi.  \n\n“There are many human rights groups who say your government has discriminated against religious minorities and sought to silence its critics. What steps are you and your government willing to take to improve the rights of Muslims and other minorities in your country and uphold free speech?” she had asked.\n\nResponding to Siddiqui’s question, Prime Minister Modi strongly defended India’s record on democracy and his government’s performance and human rights, saying that the basic foundation stone of his government has been ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Prayas’.\n\n“In India’s democratic values, there is absolutely no discrimination, neither based on caste, creed, age nor any kind of geographic location. India is a democracy. And as President Biden also mentioned, in India and America, in both countries, democracy is in our DNA. Democracy is our spirit. Democracy runs in our veins. We live in a democracy,” the PM said in his reply.\n\nThe query, however, kicked off a storm online. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, “We’re certainly here, at the White House, under this administration, committed to the freedom of the press, which is why we had the press conference last week.” We certainly condemn any efforts of intimidation or harassment of a journalist or any journalist who is just trying to do their job. And so, I just want to be very clear about that,” Jean-Pierre said. ",

The Constitution is clear about equal rights for all citizens. Even the Supreme Court has repeatedly asked for UCC, but vote bank-hungry people are opposing it.”\n\nModi also accused the Opposition of using the UCC to mislead and provoke the Muslim community. He also tore into the Opposition’s attempts to forge a joint front against the BJP for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. “The word guarantee is becoming popular nowadays. Some days ago, there was a photo op. All those in the frame collectively guarantee scams totalling Rs 20 lakh crore,” he alleged.\n\nThe country, he said, has to decide whether it wants to accept the guarantee of scams in 2024 or Modi’s guarantee of action against these scamsters. Saving themselves from action in corruption cases forms the common minimum programme of these parties, he quipped.\n\n“There is no better place than Patna, where the politicians of these parties can get the experience of being in jail,” Modi sarcastically added. It’s up to the people to decide whether or not they want to vote for their own prosperity or for dynastic politicians like the Gandhis or Pawars or Abdullahs or Akhileshs or Chandrashekars. “If you want the good of your children and grandchildren then vote for the BJP,” he said.\n\nPep talk for BJP workers at the booth level\n\nNarendra Modi addressed around 3,000 best booth-level workers of the BJP, from 501 Lok Sabha seats, at the party’s ‘Mera Booth Sabse Majboot’ event in Bhopal.

The effects of groundwater extraction on the Earth’s tilt was first discovered only in 2016, and the latest research modelled the observed tilt in Earth’s rotational pole and the movement of water. Initially, the research had only focussed on glacial and ice sheet melt, but later expanded its study sphere to groundwater extraction, too.\n\nThe researchers have found that in particular, it is the groundwater extraction in mid-latitudes that is having a more profound impact on causing the tilt, and they zeroed in on areas in Northwestern India and North America. The groundwater pumping is now being considered as one more factor to sea level rise, basically shifting of a mass from one region to another which is causing a ‘wobble effect’, but without us actually feeling it. For the size of the earth, 80 cm is just a minuscule fraction. The researchers say that it is not a concern of Earth going topsy-turvy because even normally the rotational pole does change by a few metres in a year. But this research specifically studies the contribution of groundwater extraction and redistribution and how much that has played a role in the tilt. That amounts to 80 cm. The researchers say this tilt does not risk a shift in seasons but does impact the climate. \n\nturbulence\nTHREAT TO AIR TAXIS IN CITY: GUSTS OF WIND\nNew rules are being drafted by various countries, especially Europe and the USA, to facilitate air taxi services. Indian cities, too, are not far behind, although they have to catch up. However, while all that is happening in the background, aerial vehicles for services in the city — including transporting commuters from one location to another — are now being red-flagged. There there is a warning issued from research conducted by RMIT University’s Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) Research Team in Australia that flying within city limits could pose a grave danger to the aerial vehicles from gusts of wind that could throw the flying vehicle off course, posing risks to people in them, on the ground, as well as to standing structures and buildings.\n\nThe threat is that of sudden wind gusts around city buildings and urban infrastructure. Several studies, including RMIT’s, have measured how these sudden gusts of wind can destabilise aerial vehicles, and researchers have insisted that this aspect needs to be addressed by all globally before allowing such flights to operate within the city. The problem especially plagues the low-flying aerial vehicles because they take off at low speeds, like drones, and the sudden gusts can affect their flight path within a second of them being airborne, posing a threat to those around.\n\nThey have suggested that instead of low-speed take-offs, these aerial vehicles should be modified in such a way that they need more space for high-speed take-offs that could prevent them from being impacted by these sudden gusts of wind. The sudden gusts of wind in an urban domain, the researchers say, are because of the shapes of the building and the gaps between them which cause the wind drafts to be sharper and more forceful. Research is continuing on this front, wherein they are exploring different building shapes to minimise the adverse impacts on intra-city flights. They are also studying the sensitivity of vehicles to gusts and turbulence, as well as flight-stability technologies.  ",

SRINAGAR:  With tourism in Kashmir picking up, Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor Manoj Sinha on Tuesday called for a revival of shrine tourism stating that Valley shrines can attract a huge number of people from outside the state.\n\n“Rishi, Sufi saints have strengthened unity in diversity and harmonious co-existence, which is the defining feature of our great nation and it inspires everyone to ensure peace, progress and prosperity for all,” Lt Governor said after paying obeisance at the revered Hazratbal shrine in Srinagar and conducting an on-site inspection of arrangements being put in place to facilitate devotees for Eid-ul-Adha festival.\n\nThe spiritual leaders, he said, enable the young generation to understand our common heritage and values to shape the destiny and future of society. “We welcome the suggestions from spiritual leaders and the common man to take J&K to new heights of development.”\n\nThe Lt Governor called for the revival of ‘shrine tourism’ in Kashmir saying Valley shrines have the potential to attract a large number of people from outside J&K. The way people from across India are coming for the Amarnath yatra, people can also come to see revered shrines like Hazratbal, Charar-e-Sharief and dozens of other shrines in the Valley, he said.\n\nHe called for forming a comprehensive strategy to explore all possibilities to increase tourist influx in Hazratbal, Charar-e-Sharief and other prominent religious places in J&K. “I am open to getting feedback from people, Waqaf Board and anyone else on this issue.” The revival can provide a big boost to tourism and ensure the footfall of tourists in the Valley around the year.

I will provide Rs 46,000 crore if you establish Rajendra Rathore’s rule.

The Rajasthan Congress has launched an attack on this statement and targeted the BJP and Shekhawat by sharing the video of the Union Minister on its official Twitter handle. \n\nThe Congress wrote, “This is proof of BJP’s poor attitude towards the people of Rajasthan. Witness this ‘inferior and flippant’ behaviour of Shekhawat, who halted the ERCP project and deceived the public. Those greedy for power are saying something like this.” ",

KOLKATA: Hours after chief minister Mamata Banerjee kicked off her panchayat poll campaign in Cooch Behar in North Bengal after 15 years, a Trinamool Congress worker was shot dead in Dinhata in the same district early on Tuesday, taking the death toll in poll-related-violence to 11.\n\nThe deceased has been identified as Babu Haque, who was in his mid-40s. Four other workers of the ruling party received bullet injuries in the attack. The incident took place at Gitaldaha, located along the India-Bangladesh border area in north Bengal where the BJP made deep inroads in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections by bagging seven out of eight seats.\n\nWhile the TMC held the BJP responsible for backing the attackers, the saffron party refuted the allegation.\n“Our party workers were sleeping inside a house after completing the day-long campaign when the attackers, backed by the BJP, raided the place and opened fire, targeting six of our men.\n\nBabu and other injured were taken to the nearby healthcare centre where he was declared dead on arrival. The injured workers were admitted to Cooch Behar Medical College and Hospital in critical condition,” said Anarul Haque, a local TMC leader.\n\nPolice, however, said the needle of suspicion is pointing towards a dispute over the issue of smuggling through the international border. “Gitaldaha is located along a porous border. Many residents of the area are involved in bootlegging.\n\nThe incident seems to be a fallout of a dispute between two groups involved in smuggling,” said a police officer. TMC MLA Udayan Guha accused the BJP of masterminding the incident by bringing criminals from “outside.”\n\nMamata injured as chopper makes emergency landing\n\nMamata Banerjee was injured when her helicopter made an emergency landing due to bad weather on Tuesday afternoon, officials said.

NEW DELHI:  Farmers will soon get direct phone calls and video-call advice from agriculture scientists and farm experts on their queries related to crop varieties, seed quality, pest attacks, early maturity varieties of crops, drought-tolerant seeds, irrigation tips and other issues from Kisan Call Centres (KCC).\nAt present, farmers get one-way automated voice responses to their queries, making the KCCs less effective.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture launched the call centres in 2004 to realise the potential of communication technology for the development of agriculture. The KCCs answer farmers’ queries via automated telephone calls in their language. There are 21 KCCs now spread across states.\n\nThe Union government now plans to revamp the KCC by making it more interactive, via a two-way communication system. The Centre has invited a bid asking interested parties to offer effective agricultural solutions in the digital age. In the tender floated, the Centre has mentioned how to make it a two-way communication, unlike in the current system.\n\nA senior official associated with the development said,  “The same way you enhance your culinary skills through YouTube videos, the farmers will receive videos on their smartphones. They can take suggested steps like how to spray pesticides, identify diseases, when and how much irrigation is required, and appropriate harvesting time and related facilities,” he said.\n\nThe government runs a dedicated television channel, DD KISAN, for farmers to address their challenges related to farming. “The channel demonstrates but seems ineffective in the age of smartphones,” said the officer, adding, “Our agriculture is facing more local problems due to climate change impact. The solution needs to be fine-tuned according to their need.” \n\n“If things go as planned, we will connect farmers to a group of scientists at the local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK),” he said. There are 731 KVKs functioning as knowledge resource centres of agriculture technology to improve the farm economy.\n\nNew features will make the scheme costlier\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture now plans to revamp the Kisan Call Centre by making it more interactive, via a two-way communication system. The new features at the Kisan Call Centre may raise the cost of the scheme.

The festivals of Shravani Shivratri, Nagpanchami and Rakshabandhan will be celebrated during this period, he said\n\n“While the traditional Kanwar Yatra will commence from July 4, Bakri Eid will be celebrated on June 29. This time is sensitive from the point of view of law and order. So, we have to be constantly alert and careful,” the CM said.\n\n“Respecting the belief of devotees, meat should not be allowed to be sold in the open on the Kanwar route. The route should remain clean and sanitised. There should be provision for streetlights. Since the weather is hot, arrangements of drinking water for the devotees should also be made,” directed the CM.\n\nAccording to an official statement, Adityanath asked the officials to install CCTV cameras on the yatra route and also deploy divers. The places for setting up of Kanwar camps should be marked in advance so that traffic is not obstructed. He cautioned the authorities to allow the sound of DJs within the prescribed limits during the procession.\n\n“Ensure that everyone follows the rules and regulations,” he said adding that there should be no display of weapons in religious processions.\n\n“Some mischievous elements may try to unnecessarily provoke members of other communities, keep a close eye on such moves. Additional police force should be deployed in sensitive areas with intensified foot patrolling every evening. PRV 112 should remain active, and anarchic elements should be strongly dealt with,” said CM Yogi.\n\nThe CM also appreciated the way traffic was regulated during Ramzan processions. “This time, on the occasion of Bakri Eid and Muharram, we will have to implement the same system,” he said directing the local administrations to strike a dialogue with the respective religious leaders/intellectuals.\n\nHe added that the place for the sacrifice on Bakri Eid should be marked in advance.\n\n“Sacrifice should not be done anywhere other than the previously marked place. In any case, make sure that no prohibited animal is sacrificed anywhere. There should be an action plan for the systematic disposal of waste after sacrifice in every district,” he said.\n\nLast year during Shravan, about one crore devotees of Lord Shiva offered worship at Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi, and nearly six lakh people visited the temple every Monday during the holy month.\n\nThe CM also directed the officials on the issue of religious conversion of children through gaming/chatting apps.\n\n“Incidents of illegal religious conversions have come to light in many parts of the country in recent times. We are familiar with the incident of conversion of teenage children through online gaming/chatting apps in Ghaziabad. It is very necessary to control such anti-social and anti-national incidents in time,” Adityanath said.\n\nHe further stated that the action of illegal religious conversion is being done by an international syndicate.

The Chandrayaan-3 will continue its predecessor’s mission with an aim to carry out safe landing and roving on the lunar surface. The rover will attempt to study the lunar surface.\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3, unlike its predecessors, will not contain an orbiter but instead contain a propulsion module. The propulsion module will carry one payload, the Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE).\n\nMeanwhile, the lander will also carry four payloads - Radio Anatomy of Moon Bound Hypersensitive Ionosphere and Atmosphere (RAMBHA), Chandra’s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE), Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) and the LASER Retroreflector Array (LRA). The rover will also carry two payloads - the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and the LASER Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS). ",

          "description": "Yogi Adityanath said, \"Respecting the belief of devotees, meat should not be allowed to be sold in the open on the Kanwar route. The route should remain clean and sanitised. Lucknow: In the wake of the upcoming holy month of Shrawan and the commencement of Kanwar Yatra, the UP government has issued directives to authorities concerned to check the sale of meat in the open all along the route fixed for the yatra of Shiv devotees carrying Kanwars from July 4.\n\nCM Yogi Adityanath chaired a meeting with senior officials, including police commissioners, divisional commissioners, DMs and SPs ahead of the upcoming season.\n\nHe said that this year due to “Adhimas” (additional and prolonged month), Shrawan is of two months duration. The festivals of Shravani Shivratri, Nagpanchami and Rakshabandhan will be celebrated during this period.\n\n“While the traditional Kanwar Yatra will commence from July 4, Bakri Eid will be celebrated on June 29. This time is sensitive from the point of view of law and order. So, we have to be constantly alert and careful,” the CM said.\n\n“Respecting the belief of devotees, meat should not be allowed to be sold in the open on the Kanwar route. The route should remain clean and sanitised. There should be provision for streetlights. Since the weather is hot, arrangements of drinking water for the devotees should also be made,” directed the CM.\n\nAccording to an official statement, Adityanath asked the officials to install CCTV cameras on the yatra route and also deploy divers. The places for setting up of Kanwar camps should be marked in advance so that traffic is not obstructed. He cautioned the authorities to allow the sound of DJs within the prescribed limits during the procession.\n\n“Ensure that everyone follows the rules and regulations,” he said adding that there should be no display of weapons in religious processions.\n\n“Some mischievous elements may try to unnecessarily provoke members of other communities, keep a close eye on such moves. Additional police force should be deployed in sensitive areas with intensified foot patrolling every evening. PRV 112 should remain active, and anarchic elements should be strongly dealt with,” said CM Yogi.\n\nThe CM also appreciated the way traffic was regulated during Ramzan processions. “This time, on the occasion of Bakri Eid and Muharram, we will have to implement the same system,” he said directing the local administrations to strike a dialogue with the respective religious leaders/intellectuals.\n\nHe added that the place for the sacrifice on Bakri Eid should be marked in advance. “Sacrifice should not be done anywhere other than the previously marked place. In any case, make sure that no prohibited animal is sacrificed anywhere. There should be an action plan for the systematic disposal of waste after sacrifice in every district,” he said.\n\nLast year during Shravan, about one crore devotees of Lord Shiva offered worship at Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi, and nearly six lakh people visited the temple every Monday during the holy month.\n\nThe CM also directed the officials on the issue of religious conversion of children through gaming/chatting apps.\n\n“Incidents of illegal religious conversions have come to light in many parts of the country in recent times. We are familiar with the incident of conversion of teenage children through online gaming/chatting apps in Ghaziabad. It is very necessary to control such anti-social and anti-national incidents in time,” Adityanath said.\n\nHe further stated that the action of illegal religious conversion is being done by an international syndicate.

NEW DELHI: Days after India signed a $3 billion deal with the US to procure 31 MQ-9B Predator UAV drones, the Congress on Wednesday demanded complete transparency into the agreement and also questioned the Centre about the price which it claims is four times higher than compared to other nations.\n\nAddressing a press conference at the party headquarters, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said that \"during his state visit to the US, Prime Minister Narendra Modi signed a deal to procure 31 Predator drones\".\n\nBut he added that \"we fear what happened with the Rafale deal is being repeated with the Predator agreement\".\n\nQuestioning the price of the Predator drones, Khera said: \"What other countries are buying at less than four times, India is buying 31 predator drones at $3 billion.\"\n\nHe said that for the whopping price tag, the Defence Ministry had to release an official PIB clarification and Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had to clarify that on record.\n\n\"But the people of India need answers on the process,\" Khera said, adding that these drones are of outdated technology and being bought for four times higher price, that too after putting Rs 1,500 crore in DRDO for RUSTOM and Ghatak series drones.\n\nHe questioned why no Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as reported by several news outlets, has given a nod to General Electric manufacturing F-414 jet engines in India through 100 per cent manufacturing route in collaboration with HAL on June 14 but interestingly, there was no green signal given by CCS to the $ 3 billion drone deal with the US.\n\nThe Congress asked the government why no CCS meeting was held to decide on the predator drone procurement, and why higher prices were being paid for these drones.\n\nKhera further asked that when the Indian Air Force (IAF) was having issues with higher prices then what was the urgency for the drone deal with the US.\n\nHe also questioned that when IAF has a requirement of 18 drones why the 31 drone deal.\n\nThe Congress leader also questioned what is the relationship of the GE Atomic CEO with people in government.\n\n\"Complete transparency should be brought into the drone deal. Modi government has been known for putting national security in danger,\" Khera demanded. ",
